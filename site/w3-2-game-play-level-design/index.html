<p>Verbs tell us <strong>what the player(s) can do</strong> in the game. </p>
<p>When pitching or scoping a game project, it's helpful to describe your idea in <strong>a few sentences</strong>, including verbs that introduce the main mechanic(s) of the game.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For example, when describing a premise: </p>
<blockquote><p>e.g. A (noun) that (verbs) a (noun) and (verbs) (nouns). </p></blockquote>

<p>And when describing a conditional event or state change: </p>
<blockquote><p>e.g. If / when (noun) (verbs) a (noun), a (noun) (verbs).</p></blockquote>

<p>What are the verbs in your game (meaning: what can the player do on a moment to moment basis in your game)?</p>
<p>When considering your own variations, try out different sentences that might be interesting. Remember to <strong>keep your sentences short and simple.</strong> </p>
<p>As your game grows in depth and complexity, you may find yourself with a rich collection of sentences in your game plan.</p>

<h2 id="level">Level</h2>
<p>Once you have a list of actions and events, you‚Äôll need <strong>a place</strong> for them to occur. </p>
<p><br></p>
<figure>
<blockquote>
<p>A <b>level</b> is a space where a game happens. [...] All these game spaces set <b>boundaries</b> for players to move and interact.
<br><br>
Different levels offer <b>variation</b>. For example all basketball courts have similar shapes, but an outdoor court and an indoor gym offer different <b>experiences, cultures, and moods</b>.
<br><br>
Level designers focus on how different game spaces can make players <b>feel</b> and <b>behave</b>.</p>

<p><br></p>
<h3 id="what-is-level-design">What is level design?</h3>
<p>There are two ways to understand level design:</p>
<ul>
<li>formal industrial sense of capital-L capital-D "<strong>L</strong>evel <strong>D</strong>esign" <em>without</em> environment art;</li>
<li>broad common sense "level design" which <em>includes</em> environment art / anything in a level.</li>
</ul>
<p>For your projects, you will be assessed on level design as a whole (visuals, environment properties, etc.) </p>
<p>However, at the prototyping stage when you're developing a level or game mechanic, it's more conventional to take the approach of <strong>L</strong>evel <strong>D</strong>esign, which includes building a <em>functional</em> layout with <strong>simple maps</strong> and <strong>grayboxing</strong>.</p>
<p>Think of this as wireframing a level with placeholder assets. The non-functional "art" aspects such as modeling, lighting and texture don't need to happen before you can consider things like navigation, composition, interaction, movement, trajectory, and physical feel of the game. </p>

</figure>

<p><br></p>
<p>But before we start thinking about level layout, we need to know...</p>
<h3 id="what-is-your-level-trying-to-accomplish">What is your level trying to accomplish?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Are you teaching the player a new mechanic?</li>
<li>Are you telling a story?</li>
<li>Are you making a space for recreational relaxation or competitive battle?</li>
</ul>
<p>Think through what you‚Äôre trying to do and jot down what a player should <strong>experience</strong> over the course of the level, and what should they take away from <strong>being</strong> or <strong>acting</strong> in this space?</p>
<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>In terms of the ball game, think about how the rules of the game are conveyed through <strong>visual cues or props</strong> on the original playing field's setup and design. (e.g. a line, a point, a bounded area...)</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/soccer-field.jpg" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For your projects, consider layering your level with your own intentions for:</p>
<ul>
<li>how the level directs a player's experience</li>
<li>how objects are revealed to the player</li>
<li>what the objects or places can represent</li>
<li>how time and space unfolds for the player</li>
<li>how you can work <em>with</em> the player's imagination through sensory affect, perception, and cognition / consciousness... or what we call the "phenomenology" of the player.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="layout">Layout</h3>
<p>After you‚Äôve nailed down what your goals and concepts are for your level. you can begin sketching or laying out ideas.</p>

<p>Levels of games, virtual environments, can become part of our spatial memories.</p>
<p>Some game levels rely on the cues drawn from a collectively shared spatial memory to establish a familiar scape for the players to intuitively navigate. (e.g. those who already know soccer will know what to do with a goal post.)</p>
<p>When adapting from an existing game, you may choose to reference, exclude, or modify notable or iconic characteristics of the original environment to guide your player towards different behaviours. </p>
<p>...and perhaps even subvert these expectations!</p>

<p><em>Player agency</em> is often seen as a central element of what makes games enjoyable as an interactive media, but this is definitely worth weighing against other implications of play.</p>
<p>What are the implications of <em>exercising</em> agency? 
What about games <em>without</em> agency? </p>

<h3 id="skill-vs-chance">Skill VS Chance</h3>

<figure>
<img src="../img/jeopardy.jpg">
<figcaption>-- Jeopardy</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another way of viewing chance is in terms of "risk" level -- in game design, a standard principle is to balance <strong>high risk</strong> with <strong>high reward</strong>, so players are more likely to consider taking riskier actions. </p>
<p>Risk assessments can become part of strategic play.</p>
<h3 id="strategy">Strategy</h3>
<p>What does the player need to do to win?</p>
<p>What decisions does the player make on a moment to moment basis? </p>
<p>How do they make those choices meaningfully?</p>
<p>Why would they make one choice over another?</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="thematic-treatment">Thematic Treatment</h3>
<p>Same mechanics, different theme.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../img/landlord-to-monopoly.jpg">
<figcaption>-- The first activist game was designed more than 100 years ago by a Quaker woman called Lizzie Magie (it was the first game that obtained a US patent). <br>
She believed that the main cause of poverty was land monopoly and the way to solve it was to impose a single uniform tax that would discourage speculation. So she created a game to represent this conflict. Thirty years later a man called Charles Darrow patented a modification of the landlord‚Äôs game and turned into a ‚Äúpro landlord‚Äù game. It would later become Monopoly.</figcaption>

<p><br></p>
<p>Scaling the difficulty of your level in incremental levels can reward players at different stages of mastery. </p>
<p>And at a particular equilibrium of challenge and skill, you may reach the <em>flow channel</em>.</p>

<p>But if you are considering a more polemical approach that requries moments of critical reflection, you may consider going <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262045506/against-flow/">against flow</a>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When adjusting the difficulty of your ball game adaptation, consider the components that offer challenges to (and thus demand mastery skill) from your player. </p>
<p>How can you complicate these components? Does changing/removing/amplifying/negating any of these make for something more interesting?</p>
<p>Maybe the result isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúgood‚Äù game, but it becomes interesting, unexpected, outrageous‚Ä¶ </p>
