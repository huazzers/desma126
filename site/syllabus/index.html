<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>This course introduces the fundamentals of programming interactive projects in game development software. </p>
<p>Classwork focuses on familiarizing students with game engines, computer programming concepts, player experience, and other skills that are foundational to making digital games.</p>
<p>Lectures, exercises, and class projects teach skills needed to create digital games including custom rules, interactive physics systems, vectors, generative or randomized levels, save data, custom input systems, score-keeping, and sound. </p>
<p>This course is offered in parallel with the concurrent courses, Game Design and Interactive Animation.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="course-prerequisites">Course Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>DESMA 24 Interactivity</li>
</ul>
<p>We will revisit many of the same concepts covered in Interactivity, but using the C# scripting language and the Unity scripting API. If you haven‚Äôt taken DESMA 24, but have prior experience with Unity and C#, please let me know.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to create a real-time, interactive software with custom rules, generative or randomized levels, save data, responsive controls, physics, sound, and simple animation.

</blockquote>
<h3 id="evaluation-criteria">Evaluation Criteria</h3>
<h4 id="projects">Projects</h4>
<p>Considering the likelihood that everyone is coming in with different skillsets and coding experiences, the expectation for this class is that <strong>you approach each project with your own level of skill and comfort in mind.</strong> Design a project for yourself that <strong>pushes your technical skills a little bit</strong>, but also allows you to <strong>lean into your existing strengths and practices.</strong></p>
<p>We will evaluate your projects based on:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timely submission</strong></br>Did you submit your project on time? (see <a href="#late-work"><em>Late Work</em></a> for more details.)</li>
<li><strong>Completion of Project Deliverables</strong></br>Does your project meet the requirements of the assignment?</li>
<li><strong>Attention to detail and craft</strong></br>Does the project run? Are there unintended bugs, glitches, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Project scope / aesthetic and technical ambition</strong></br>Are you doing the bare minimum, or are you pushing yourself technically and/or aesthetically? </li>
<li><strong>Creative risk-taking and resourcefulness</strong></br>Are you pushing the limits of the tools? Hacky solutions are perfectly acceptable and encouraged!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="readings-homeplays">Readings / Homeplays</h4>
<p>You will be assigned occasional readings and games that are related to this course, accompanied by a questionnaire for you to complete and bring to class. These are graded pass/fail -- if you did the work, you will get full credit.</p>
<h4 id="participation-attendance">Participation / Attendance</h4>
<p>This is an <strong>in-person course</strong>, so please come to class on time. We will be covering a lot of content quickly, so it is <em>very</em> important that you are present for each day. </p>
<p>If you are more than 15 minutes late, you will be marked as late. Three late marks results in an unexcused absence. <strong>Any disputes should be discussed with the TA within two weeks</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you anticipate having to miss class, email the TA prior to the class.</strong> Absences will not be excused after the fact, except in extreme circumstances. You get <strong>one</strong> unexcused absence before it starts affecting your grade. Each unexcused absence that follows will result in one full letter grade deduction from your participation score. </p>
<p>Your participation grade will also be determined by your level of engagement in class. If you seem disengaged or are disruptive in class, we will reach out and discuss the matter with you. If a pattern of disruption or disengagement continues, we will be taking note and it will be reflected in your grade.</p>
<h3 id="other-assignment-related-rules">Other assignment-related rules</h3>
<h4 id="late-work">Late Work</h4>
<p><strong>On the day the project is due:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Projects should be <strong>ready to play</strong> prior to the beginning of class.</li>
<li>Project files and documentation should be <strong>submitted by 11:59PM</strong> the same day.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the due date, a full letter grade will be deducted from the project grade for each class day that the assignment is late. </p>
<p><strong>If you anticipate that you won‚Äôt be able to complete the work by the due date, please contact us <em>before</em> the due date so we can discuss options.</strong></p>
<h4 id="appropriation-fair-use-and-generated-content">Appropriation, Fair Use, and Generated Content</h4>
<p><strong>You should strive to develop your own assets for your project submissions.</strong> </p>
<p>The use of existing prompt-based AI generation programs, including but not limited to ChatGPT, DALLE, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney, is not allowed in this class. You may consider this to be one of the limitations of this class -- you are here to learn a specific set of technical skills, and the most advisable way to engage with this course is to not use these programs at all. There are <a href="#recommended-tools">many other reliable solutions and resources</a> available to you, please use this opportunity to explore them.</p>
<p>If you're planning to borrow or generate assets from somewhere else, you must consult the instructor beforehand AND be able to justify your decision for doing so. While developing early stage prototypes and testing mechanics, it is acceptable to use placeholder assets.</p>
<p><strong>No credit will be awarded for plagiarised work.</strong> All submitted projects should be original and developed within the duration of this class. Remember to acknowledge / cite your tools and sources appropriately in your submission.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<h3 id="readings-games">Readings / Games</h3>
<p>All assigned readings and games will be provided for you -- no need to purchase textbooks for this class. (see <a href="../readings-and-homeplays/"><em>Readings &amp; Homeplays</em></a> for more details.)</p>

<h3 id="land-acknowledgement">Land Acknowledgement</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The University of California, Los Angeles occupies the ancestral, traditional, and contemporary Lands of the Tongva and Chumash peoples. Our ability to gather and learn here is the result of coercion, dispossession, and colonization. We are grateful for the land itself and the people that have stewarded it through generations. While a land acknowledgment is not enough, it is the first step in the work toward supporting decolonial and indigenous movements for sovereignty and self-determination. Read more about what land you‚Äôre occupying: <a href="https://native-land.ca/">https://native-land.ca/</a> </p>

<!--UCLA is a land grant institution that continues to benefit from federal land theft and genocide of indigenous peoples. Statewide UC campuses are built upon Native American land, among which include sacred burial sites that have yet to be fully repatriated to their respective indigenous communities. Today, UCLA is one of the largest landlords in the region, and remains complicit in furthering the expatriation of indigenous peoples both locally and internationally. 

We're all living in the meta-game engine called the occupational forces of the US, and our ability to gather here is the result of the crimes against humanity outlined above. This acknowledgement should not serve to absolve one of settler guilt, but instead remind us of the deeply entrenched roots of colonialism, its mundane violence, and our subsequent participation in these systems as members of this campus.-->

<h3 id="commitment-to-diversity-safer-spaces">Commitment to Diversity &amp; Safer Spaces</h3>
<p>We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use preferred pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however our differences affect our conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students, TA, and instructor is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one another. Alternatively, if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructor or TA. </p>

<h3 id="academic-integrity-and-information-on-student-conduct">Academic Integrity and Information on Student Conduct</h3>
<p>UCLA is a community of scholars. In this community, all members including faculty, staff and students alike are responsible for maintaining standards of academic honesty. As a student and member of the University community, you are here to get an education and are, therefore, expected to demonstrate integrity in your academic endeavors. You are evaluated on your own merits. Cheating, plagiarism, collaborative work, multiple submissions without the permission of the professor, or other kinds of academic dishonesty are considered unacceptable behavior and will result in formal disciplinary proceedings usually resulting in suspension or dismissal. As specified in the <a href="https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/studentconductcode">UCLA Student Conduct Code</a>, violations or attempted violations of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to, cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, multiple submissions or facilitating academic dishonesty. When a student is suspected to have engaged in academic dishonesty, Academic Senate regulations require that the instructor report the allegation to the office of the Dean of Students. For more information, see the <a href="https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/studentconductcode">UCLA Student Conduct Code</a>.</p>
