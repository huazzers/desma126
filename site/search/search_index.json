Classwork focuses on familiarizing students with game engines, computer programming concepts, player experience, and other skills that are foundational to making digital games. Lectures, exercises, and class projects teach skills needed to create digital games including custom rules, interactive physics systems, vectors, generative or randomized levels, save data, custom input systems, score-keeping, and sound. This course is offered in parallel with the concurrent courses, Game Design and Interactive Animation. Course Prerequisites DESMA 24 Interactivity We will revisit many of the same concepts covered in Interactivity, but using the C# scripting language and the Unity scripting API. If you haven\u2019t taken DESMA 24, but have prior experience with Unity and C#, please let me know. Learning Outcomes By the end of this course, you will be able to create a real-time, interactive software with custom rules, generative or randomized levels, save data, responsive controls, physics, sound, and simple animation. The skills you will learn in this class translate well to immersive media, generative animation, and other modes of human-computer expression. Course Outline Unit 1: Generative Computation Using generative design to create random/unique/dynamic ecosystems, worlds, characters, and events in Unity. Week 0-3 Intro to Unity Game Engine and C# , Prefabs and Instantiation , Coroutines, Events, UI Project 1: Auto-Generator Unit 2: Engineering for Play Using physics, math, and other game engine tools to design environments and mechanics for interactive gameplay. Week 3-6 Level Design , Vector fundamentals , Physics Simulations , Input Systems , Inventory, Persistent Data, Sound Project 2: Ball Game Remix Intermission: Alt-Engines Explore other tiny game engines! Week 6/7 Micro Game Jam -- Collaborate in teams, make an entire game in a single class. Unit 3: Game as Engine Other game engine tools for refining your projects. Week 7-10 Cinemachine, Multiplayer, AI Navigation, etc. Project 3: Final Project Assignments and Grading See How To Submit on instructions for submitting Unity projects Course Breakdown Project 1: 15% Project 2: 25% Project 3: 25% Reading / Homeplay responses: 15% Participation / Attendance: 20% Evaluation Criteria Projects Considering the likelihood that everyone is coming in with different skillsets and coding experiences, the expectation for this class is that you approach each project with your own level of skill and comfort in mind. Design a project for yourself that pushes your technical skills a little bit , but also allows you to lean into your existing strengths and practices. We will evaluate your projects based on: Timely submission Did you submit your project on time? (see Late Work for more details.) Completion of Project Deliverables Does your project meet the requirements of the assignment? Attention to detail and craft Does the project run? Are there unintended bugs, glitches, etc. Project scope / aesthetic and technical ambition Are you doing the bare minimum, or are you pushing yourself technically and/or aesthetically? Creative risk-taking and resourcefulness Are you pushing the limits of the tools? Hacky solutions are perfectly acceptable and encouraged! Readings / Homeplays You will be assigned occasional readings and games that are related to this course, accompanied by a questionnaire for you to complete and bring to class. These are graded pass/fail -- if you did the work, you will get full credit. Participation / Attendance This is an in-person course , so please come to class on time. We will be covering a lot of content quickly, so it is very important that you are present for each day. If you are more than 15 minutes late, you will be marked as late. Three late marks results in an unexcused absence. Any disputes should be discussed with the TA within two weeks If you anticipate having to miss class, email the TA prior to the class. Absences will not be excused after the fact, except in extreme circumstances. You get one unexcused absence before it starts affecting your grade. Each unexcused absence that follows will result in one full letter grade deduction from your participation score. Your participation grade will also be determined by your level of engagement in class. If you seem disengaged or are disruptive in class, we will reach out and discuss the matter with you. If a pattern of disruption or disengagement continues, we will be taking note and it will be reflected in your grade. Other assignment-related rules Late Work On the day the project is due: Projects should be ready to play prior to the beginning of class. Project files and documentation should be submitted by 11:59PM the same day. After the due date, a full letter grade will be deducted from the project grade for each class day that the assignment is late. If you anticipate that you won\u2019t be able to complete the work by the due date, please contact us before the due date so we can discuss options. Appropriation, Fair Use, and Generated Content You should strive to develop your own assets for your project submissions. If major portions of your project have been borrowed or generated, particularly audio, visual, and textual content, they must be conceptually significant to your project and you should be able to justify their inclusion. While developing early stage prototypes and testing mechanics, it is perfectly acceptable to use placeholder assets. Resources Required Tools Unity -- Please install Unity Hub and get the latest LTS version of Unity Editor (currently 2022.3.43f1). Other editor versions may differ slightly from each other, but anything 2021 or later should be ok. Visual Studio -- Install Microsoft Visual Studio with Unity Hub while you are installing Unity. Alternatively, VS Code or VS Community should be fine. Recommended Tools 2D and 3D production software of your choice -- you will be expected to develop your own assets for projects (see Appropriation, Fair Use, and Generated Content for more details.) Here are some tools I recommend: Krita -- powerful open source digital paint tool Blender -- fully featured open source 3D art and animation tool Piskel -- free pixel art app Aseprite -- inexpensive pixel art / animation tool Sculptris -- \u201cA gateway into the exciting world of 3D.\u201d Crocotile 3d -- A tool for creating 3d scenes with 2d tiles. Mixamo -- Free, but requires a login. Includes community sourced walk cycles and 3D animations which you can apply to any model that can T-pose. freesound.org -- audio database that has search filters sorted by licenses. login required for downloading files. good source for adding sound effects and music to your projects. For more tools, check out this exhaustive list of cheap and free tools compiled by Everest Pipkin . Readings / Games All required readings and games will be provided for you -- no need to purchase textbooks for this class. (see Readings & Homeplays for more details.) Campus-wide resources and information Land Acknowledgement The UCLA version: The University of California, Los Angeles occupies the ancestral, traditional, and contemporary Lands of the Tongva and Chumash peoples. Our ability to gather and learn here is the result of coercion, dispossession, and colonization. We are grateful for the land itself and the people that have stewarded it through generations. While a land acknowledgment is not enough, it is the first step in the work toward supporting decolonial and indigenous movements for sovereignty and self-determination. Read more about what land you\u2019re occupying: https://native-land.ca/ Other resources on land repatriation: UCLA Mapping Indigenous LA -- an online archive of a storymapping research project about indigenous Los Angeles peoples, histories, and geographies from past and present. California History (Winter 2023), Respecting the Ancestors: On Repatriating American Indian Remains -- essay report on the history of repatriating indigenous peoples remains (mostly a lack thereof), including UC-specific case studies. Decolonization is not a metpahor -- article on what is unsettling about decolonisation as a caution against the loose use of the term in advocacy and scholarship. Commitment to Diversity & Safer Spaces We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use preferred pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however our differences affect our conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students, TA, and instructor is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one another. Alternatively, if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructor or TA. (Statement adopted from voidLab at https://github.com/voidlab/diversity-statement ) COVID-19 It is important that everyone stay safe and avoid coming to class if you have any concerns about your health status.
