Classwork focuses on familiarizing students with game engines, computer programming concepts, player experience, and other skills that are foundational to making digital games. Lectures, exercises, and class projects teach skills needed to create digital games including custom rules, interactive physics systems, vectors, generative or randomized levels, save data, custom input systems, score-keeping, and sound. This course is offered in parallel with the concurrent courses, Game Design and Interactive Animation. Course Prerequisites DESMA 24 Motion DESMA 101 Media Arts Introduction / DESMA 104 Design Futures This course will be heavy on C# scripting in Unity scripting API. If you haven't fulfilled the above pre-requisites but have prior experience in either writing code or using the Unity game engine , please let me know. Learning Outcomes By the end of this course, you will be able to create a real-time, interactive software with custom rules, generative or randomized levels, save data, responsive controls, physics, sound, and simple animation. The skills you will learn in this class translate well to immersive media, generative animation, and other modes of human-computer expression. Course Outline Unit 1: Generative Computation Using generative design to create random/unique/dynamic ecosystems, worlds, characters, and events in Unity. Week 0-3 Intro to Unity Game Engine and C# , Vector fundamentals , Prefabs and Instantiation , Arrays and Randomness, UI Project 1: Auto-Generator Unit 2: Playing with Physics Using physics, math, and other game engine tools to design environments and mechanics for interactive gameplay. Week 4-6 Level Design , Input Systems , Physics Simulations , Static Variables and Singletons, Sound Project 2: Ball Game Remix Intermission: Alt-Engines Explore other tiny game engines! Week 7 Micro Game Jam(s) -- Make an entire game in a single class. Unit 3: Save && Scene Using persistent data, effects, and cinematic affordances of the game engine to revise and refine your projects. Week 8-10 Cinemachine, Animation, Coroutines, Persistent Data Project 3: Final Project (TBD) Assignments and Grading See How To Submit on instructions for submitting Unity projects Course Breakdown Project 1: 15% Project 2: 25% Project 3: 25% Reading / Homeplay responses: 15% Participation / Attendance: 20% Evaluation Criteria Projects Considering the likelihood that everyone is coming in with different skillsets and coding experiences, the expectation for this class is that you approach each project with your own level of skill and comfort in mind. Design a project for yourself that pushes your technical skills a little bit , but also allows you to lean into your existing strengths and practices. We will evaluate your projects based on: Timely submission Did you submit your project on time? (see Late Work for more details.) Completion of Project Deliverables Does your project meet the requirements of the assignment? Attention to detail and craft Does the project run? Are there unintended bugs, glitches, etc. Project scope / aesthetic and technical ambition Are you doing the bare minimum, or are you pushing yourself technically and/or aesthetically? Creative risk-taking and resourcefulness Are you pushing the limits of the tools? Hacky solutions are perfectly acceptable and encouraged! Readings / Homeplays You will be assigned occasional readings and games that are related to this course, accompanied by a questionnaire for you to complete and bring to class. These are graded pass/fail -- if you did the work, you will get full credit. Participation / Attendance This is an in-person course , so please come to class on time. We will be covering a lot of content quickly, so it is very important that you are present for each day. If you are more than 15 minutes late, you will be marked as late. Three late marks results in an unexcused absence. Any disputes should be discussed with the TA within two weeks If you anticipate having to miss class, email the TA prior to the class. Absences will not be excused after the fact, except in extreme circumstances. You get one unexcused absence before it starts affecting your grade. Each unexcused absence that follows will result in one full letter grade deduction from your participation score. Your participation grade will also be determined by your level of engagement in class. If you seem disengaged or are disruptive in class, we will reach out and discuss the matter with you. If a pattern of disruption or disengagement continues, we will be taking note and it will be reflected in your grade. Other assignment-related rules Late Work On the day the project is due: Projects should be ready to play prior to the beginning of class. Project files and documentation should be submitted by 11:59PM the same day. After the due date, a full letter grade will be deducted from the project grade for each class day that the assignment is late. If you anticipate that you won\u2019t be able to complete the work by the due date, please contact us before the due date so we can discuss options. Appropriation, Fair Use, and Generated Content You should strive to develop your own assets for your project submissions. The use of existing prompt-based AI generation programs, including but not limited to ChatGPT, DALLE, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney, is not allowed in this class. You may consider this to be one of the limitations of this class -- you are here to learn a specific set of technical skills, and the most advisable way to engage with this course is to not use these programs at all. There are many other reliable solutions and resources available to you, please use this opportunity to explore them. If you're planning to borrow or generate assets from somewhere else, you must consult the instructor beforehand AND be able to justify your decision for doing so. While developing early stage prototypes and testing mechanics, it is acceptable to use placeholder assets. No credit will be awarded for plagiarised work. All submitted projects should be original and developed within the duration of this class. Remember to acknowledge / cite your tools and sources appropriately in your submission. Resources Readings / Games All assigned readings and games will be provided for you -- no need to purchase textbooks for this class. (see Readings & Homeplays for more details.) Required Tools Unity -- Please install Unity Hub and get the latest LTS version of Unity Editor (currently 2022.3.43f1). Other editor versions may differ slightly from each other, but anything 2021 or later should be ok.

Campus-wide resources and information Land Acknowledgement The University of California, Los Angeles occupies the ancestral, traditional, and contemporary Lands of the Tongva and Chumash peoples. Our ability to gather and learn here is the result of coercion, dispossession, and colonization. We are grateful for the land itself and the people that have stewarded it through generations. While a land acknowledgment is not enough, it is the first step in the work toward supporting decolonial and indigenous movements for sovereignty and self-determination. Read more about what land you\u2019re occupying: https://native-land.ca/ Other resources on land repatriation: UCLA Mapping Indigenous LA -- an online archive of a storymapping research project about indigenous Los Angeles peoples, histories, and geographies from past and present. California History (Winter 2023), Respecting the Ancestors: On Repatriating American Indian Remains -- 2023 essay report on the history of repatriating indigenous peoples remains (mostly a lack thereof), including UC-specific case studies. Decolonization is not a metaphor -- article on what is unsettling about decolonisation as a caution against the loose use of the term in advocacy and scholarship. Commitment to Diversity & Safer Spaces We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use preferred pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however our differences affect our conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students, TA, and instructor is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one another. Alternatively, if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructor or TA. (Statement adopted from voidLab at https://github.com/voidlab/diversity-statement ) COVID-19 It is important that everyone stay safe and avoid coming to class if you have any concerns about your health status. If you find that external struggles and/or COVID related challenges are affecting your ability to attend class, please reach out to us. We want you to be successful in the class, but we care about your well-being more than anything else. Open communication with us is most important in this regard, please let us know if you're sick and/or require additional accommodations. Students must adhere to the current campus directives related to COVID-19 mitigation, and refusal to do so may result in the student being asked to leave the classroom or referred to the Dean of Students.

We can\u2019t talk about a game without talking about the experience of the player playing that game, even if the playing experience we\u2019re talking about is often our own. The experience we call a game is created by the interaction between different rules , but the rules themselves aren\u2019t the game, the interaction is!

PLAYER BEHAVIOUR -- are players only allowed to travel in a certain manner (e.g. speedwalking, but no running), and how can that be enforced (e.g. speedwalking means both feet cannot be lifted off the ground at the same time at any moment.)

Technically, this question is irrelevant to this class. Regardless of what you end up making for your assignments, you'll eventually have to make decisions about the parameters and conditions of your project (which you could think of as being \"the rules of your game\") and consider how one's interaction / encounter of these \"rules\" will affect their overall experience of it. In this class, we will focus on how to implement these rules using game engines , so that you can explore its creative affordances for designing particular experiences.

Returning to our first question: What is a game engine? -- guess we doin games now by morry kolman (@WTTDOTM) Tools designed specifically for developing games (e.g. Unity, Bitsy , PICO-8 , in-game level builders ) Platforms which primarily serve some other non-game-making function (if any at all), but are nonetheless used for making games. (e.g. Spread sheets , Checkboxes , Post-war junkyards and bombsites ) -- When Play Is Criminalized: Racial Disparities in Childhood . Eisa Nefertari Ulen, TRUTHOUT. If a game is \"an experience that is made from the interaction between different rules\" , then broadly speaking, a game engine could be anything that converts rules and interaction into playable experiences. Unity is a Game Engine We'll spend most of this course working in the Unity game engine. Unity, initially released in 2005, is a closed-source game engine, and Unity Technologies, the developer of the engine, has been a publicly traded company since 2020. The engine gained popularity through being free for small, independent developers, with a relatively easy learning curve. Compared to most other game engines, Unity also tries to avoid being aesthetically identifiable and not be tied to a particular genre of game. Other industries use Unity for things like Architectural and Auto rendering, Film and TV production , AI training and computer vision . Unity also contracts with the US Department of Defense for military training and simulation. Anatomy of the Unity Editor -- Unity Editor window in default workspace layout Read the following articles from the Unity User Manual: Unity's interface GameObjects Transforms Using Components Unity C# Unity uses C#, a type of object-oriented language , as one of its primary scripting languages. We typically write Unity C# scripts to make customised blueprints for accessing, organising, and implementing data inside our game project. This is helpful for: storing information such as variables and functions inside an object or class ; programming interactive / dynamic behaviour in objects; Most of the time, we're working with a class called MonoBehaviour which behaves like a component that can be attached to any gameobject in our scene. Let's create a Unity C# script! Here's the general thought process when figuring out what to put in our script: OUTPUT -- \"I need my script to do THIS ...\" INPUT -- \"... so I need to access THESE VARIABLES ...\" METHOD -- \"... and call THESE FUNCTIONS in order of THIS SEQUENCE .\" Anatomy of a C# Script Watch this video for a brief introduction to C# Variables and Functions in Unity. Script Name use pascal case, e.g. MyScript.cs the file name of the script and the name of the MonoBehaviour must be exactly the same (case-sensitive). e.g. if your C# file name is \"ScoreManager.cs\", then the line declaring your Monobehaviour class in that script file should look like this: public class ScoreManager : MonoBehaviour {...} the name must be unique -- no two MonoBehaviours should have the same name. Namespace A reference library containing all the methods and classes for a specific context. using UnityEngine Variables Variables are labelled data containers that can be assigned values, and whose read/write access can be set by declaring them as public or private. If a variable property exists somewhere in a component, there's likely some way to access it via scripting (to learn more, Unity scripting reference is your best friend!) When creating variables: declare access permissions in lowercase (default: private ) declare what type of variable it is float - a numerical value that can be in decimals int - a numerical integer (whole numbers only) bool - binary property that can be either assigned 'true' or 'false' string - a sequence of characters other public classes including GameObject and components (e.g. Transform ) name the variable no spaces allowed. use camel case. int numberOfCamels use clear and descriptive nouns, the intent of this variable should be immediately apparent from its name if it is a bool, prefix with a verb (typically phrase as a question.) bool isWalking, hasSpecialAbility; use prefixes with an underscore to differentiate private member variables from public ones. private bool _currentHealth; private static int s_winScore; Functions There are two main types of functions: method functions -- a way to group lines of code under one name; good for if you need to call a specific set of codes multiple times; event functions -- automatically tells Unity what to do at very particular instances in the game. Functions may take in variables as arguments. When creating functions: declare access permissions in lowercase (default: private ) what type of value it returns in lowercase (if any) -- void returns no value. name of the function in pascal case, followed by parenthesis containing any argument variables. float MultiplyByTwo(float initialFloat){...} Key principles of Programming in Unity C# Single Responsibility -- Every module of code (class, function, etc.) should have a one and only purpose in the software functionality. This will be very helpful for: debugging scripts making your scripts easily reusable for other projects. Keep everything private unless it absolutely needs to be public. if a variable just needs to be visible in the Inspector but does not need to be publicly accessible, you should keep it private then add [SerializeField] before it. [SerializeField] bool _currentIndex; Anticipate errors, and help your script help you catch them if your script absolutely needs a type of component, precede your Monobehaviour declaration with [RequireComponent(typeof(ComponentName))] use Debug.Log and Debug.Error to check for incorrect / null references. Use comments to contextualise your lines of code Exercise before next class Can you write a script that forces a GameObject to start at a specific position in the scene?","title":"Intro to Game Engine, Unity, and C&#35;"},{"location":"w0-unity-csharp/#intro-to-game-engine-unity-and-c","text":"","title":"Intro to Game Engine, Unity, and C&#35;"},{"location":"w0-unity-csharp/#what-is-a-game-engine","text":"Let's break this question down.

Review from last class GameObjects and Components C# Variables and Functions : How to declare and initialise a variable? How to write and call a custom method function? Event functions -- void Start() and void Update() Exercise from last class Can you write a script that forces a GameObject to start at a specific position in the scene? Transforms Read about Transforms in the Unity Manual. Every GameObject has a Transform component, which can be accessed via scripts using gameObject.GetComponent<Transform>() or gameObject.transform . Using the Transform component, you may access the following properties: Position , Rotation , and Scale Parent-Child Hierarchy Global and Local Transforms Vectors Read about Vector3 in the Unity Manual. A vector is a group of numbers -- a 2D vector contains two values (x, y), and a 3D vector contains three values (x, y, z). In Unity, 3D vectors are represented by a data structure called Vector3 , which contains three float values represented by x, y, and z respectively. Vector3(float x, float y, float z) When handling spatial and directional information in three dimensional contexts, we are typically working with Vector3 data structures. Vector3 variables and properties To declare and initialise a Vector3 variable: Vector3 someVector = new Vector3(2,4,5); // \"Vector3\" on the LEFT declares what type of variable \"someVector\" is; // \"new Vector3()\" on the RIGHT acts as a constructor method // that creates and initialises a new Vector3 with xyz-values (2, 4, and 5). Note: Even in 2D projects, transform properties are still stored as Vector3 data. In this context, you could choose to declare Vector3 variables in this way: someVector = new Vector3(2,4); // which is the same as \"new Vector3(2,4,0)\" (ie. z-value is 0) To access x, y, and z components of a Vector3: Debug.Log(someVector.x); Debug.Log(someVector.y); Debug.Log(someVector.z); In Unity, you can also use shorthands for calling specific 3D vectors. Vector3.zero //Vector3(0,0,0) Vector3.one //Vector3(1,1,1) Vector3.forward //Vector3(0,0,1) Vector3.right //Vector3(1,0,0) Vector3.up //Vector3(0,1,0) //etc. Using Vectors in Unity Vectors can represent position , scale , rotation , and direction of an object in space, relative to X, Y, and Z axes. Position Vector3 as spatial coordinates. Origin is at (0,0,0). Scale Vector3 as relative scale. Rotation Vector3 as rotational configuration. In Unity, rotation values are internally processed as Quarternion values, which are more convenient for the computer to work with. In the inspector, we are reading eulerAngle representations of rotation in degrees along the X, Y, and Z axes. Direction Vector3 as relative direction. Vector Math Operations Addition (+) Make an object move at a given velocity position += velocity * Time.deltaTime; Make an object move at an accelerated velocity velocity += acceleration * Time.deltaTime; position += velocity * Time.deltaTime; Make an object (e.g. camera) follow another object at a given offset Usually it's easier to do this by parenting one object to another, but sometimes that configuration just doesn't work for your purposes... In that case, you may consider using vector math! Unity's Roll-a-ball tutorial uses a similar technique for setting up a camera that follows the player object. //LateUpdate is another event function //that is called every frame, but after Update() void LateUpdate() { //follow target position at offset //AFTER target position changes in Update() gameObject.transform.position = target.position + offset; } Spawn objects at regular intervals We'll discuss this next class when we get into arrays and instantiation! Subtraction (-) Determine direction from one point to another fromAToB = B - A; //and if we just need the unit of this direction vector //we can normalize it. unitDirection = fromAToB.normalized; Determine the distance between 2 points fromAToB = B - A; float distanceAB = fromAToB.magnitude; //OR we can use the Vector3 method \"Distance()\" float distanceAB = Vector3.Distance(A,B); Multiplication (*) Scale the size / length of a vector someVector *= multiplier; Flipping a vector's direction someVector *= -1; Normalizing Vectors Normalized vectors always have a magnitude of 1. This is useful for when you're using vectors only for its directional orientation. normalizedVector = someVector.normalized; Dot Product Read about Vector3.Dot in the Unity Manual. Dot product is useful for comparing the directions of two different vectors. float dotProductAB = Vector3.Dot(A,B); if (dotProductAB==0){ //A and B are perpendicular } else if (dotProductAB==1){ //A and B are pointing in exactly the same direction } else if (dotProductAB==-1){ //A and B are pointing in completely opposite directions } Cross Product Read about Vector3.Cross in the Unity Manual. Cross product can produce a new vector that is perpendicular to two vectors. Vector3 OA = A - O; Vector3 OB = B = O; Vector3 crossAB = Vector3.Cross(OA,OB); //crossAB is perpendcular to both vectors OA and OB.

Prefabs Read about Prefabs in the Unity Manual. Prefabs allow you to store a GameObject and its information (including its components, property values, child objects, etc.) into your Unity project folder as a reusable Asset . This Prefab Asset can be used as a base template from which you can create and modify new Prefab instances in the scene. How to create a Prefab from an existing GameObject in the scene Click and drag the GameObject from the Scene Hierarchy into your project folder panel. The GameObject should now be marked with a blue icon, and have an arrow button to the right of its name that leads you to the Prefab editor. How to Instantiate a GameObject We use the Instantiate() method function to spawn new instances of a GameObject in our scene. Instantiate(someGameObject); You could also pass a GameObject instance into a GameObject variable . This allows you to reference it later in your script. GameObject obj = Instantiate(someGameObject); //let's say we want to change the position of this instance obj.transform.position = someVector; //or set it to a new parent obj.transform.parent = someParentObject; The Instantiate() method can also be called in other ways that allow you to pass multiple parameters at once . The Unity Scripting API lists all the different ways you can declare the Instantiate() function. For example: GameObject obj = Instantiate( spawnThisGameObject, //GameObject atSomePosition, //Vector3 atSomeQuaternionRotation, //Quaternion underSomeParent); //Transform Loops Loop functions allow you to repeat an action multiple times. Watch the Unity Tutorial below to learn about: While loops Do-while Loops For Loops ... and one more video about Foreach Loops . Arrays Read about Arrays in the Unity Manual. Arrays allow you to store multiple objects in a single variable . Each object in an array is attached to an index number, starting from 0 . This index number is used when calling this object from the array. string[] fruits = {\"apples\", \"pears\", \"oranges\"}; // string[0] will return \"apples\" // string[1] ... \"pears\" // string[2] ... \"oranges\" Every array has a Length property, which gives you the number elements in the array. string[] fruits = {\"apples\", \"pears\", \"oranges\"}; Debug.Log(\"Length of fruits array: \"+ fruits.Length); // console will print \"Length of fruits array: 3\".
