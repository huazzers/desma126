Some bugs will only reveal themselves in a build, so make sure to catch those in advance of the deadline. A broken game will affect your project grade. Submission Checklist You should include the following documentation of your project by 11:59PM on the day of the project deadline : Visual documentation : at least ONE animated GIF of your project in motion, roughly 600 pixels wide, ideally under 5MB in size. at least TWO stills from your project (1920x1080) (Optional) Recording of gameplay. Roughly 60 seconds, long enough to demonstrate how your game is played (1920x1080, mp4/h.264) Text description that would be useful for someone viewing your project for the first time: The basic premise of the game -- what is it about? How to play the game -- how do you interact with the project? Project build for WINDOWS Exported Unity package Tools for Visual Documentation Animated GIFs Animated GIFs are durable and easy to view (though not always small in size). In this course we will use animated GIFs as a quasi-archival format for animated visual material. Preferably, they should be 600 pixels wide and under 5MB in file size. I personally use and recommend ScreenToGif , which is a good tool for quickly making a gif. Photoshop, Premiere, AfterEffects, or other video editors can also export gifs. You may also find the following free tools helpful: EzGif.com is an online GIF maker, editor, and compressor. Great for reducing the file size of GIFs. LICEcap is a badly-named free OSX app which can capture an area of your screen and save it directly to an animated GIF. Online-convert.com offers a browser tool for converting videos into GIFs. Screenshots and Screen Recordings Make a build first and run it full screen to capture images and video of your project. For screen recordings, OBS works very well. You may also use the Unity Recorder to capture single frames and videos from within the Unity Editor. Built-in OS screenshot shortcuts: Windows To take a screenshot and automatically save the file, press the Windows key + PrtScn . Your screen will go dim and a screenshot of your entire screen will save to the Pictures > Screenshots folder . Also consider the snipping tool, which is a convenient way to capture a portion of your screen. Mac To take a screenshot, press Shift + Command + 3 . If you see a thumbnail in the corner of your screen, click it to edit the screenshot. Or wait for the screenshot to save to your desktop. By default, screenshots save to your desktop with the name \u201dScreen Shot [date] at [time].png.\u201d How to export projects from Unity Building your project Start by opening the build settings under File > Build Settings . Add all the scenes you want to include in your project by clicking and dragging them from your assets folder to \u201cScenes in Build\u201d (also remove any scenes you don\u2019t want to include). The topmost scene in this list will be the first to play when starting the game. Create a Windows build by changing Target Platform to \u201cWindows\u201d and clicking build. After the build has finished, create a zipped folder containing all of the files and folders that unity created. The build needs all these folders, exes, and dlls to run properly. Unity Packages Read the official documentation for exporting and importing Unity packages . Rather than creating a zip file of your entire Unity project folder, you can save a lot of time (and space) by exporting only the assets for the scenes, materials, prefabs, etc. that you want to share. This is called exporting an asset package. Exporting Unity Packages You have two options: Find your scene file in the Project tab, right click the scene, and click \u201cExport Package\u2026\u201d OR Click Assets > Export Package\u2026 In the window that opens, de-select any assets that you don\u2019t want to include. Be careful that you don\u2019t exclude anything required to run your scene. If you only had your scene selected when clicking Export Package\u2026 , the window will only display the assets directly used in that scene. You can select entire folders, or even the top level Assets folder to bring up more assets to include in the export. Make sure the Include dependencies box is checked and click Export\u2026 to save your unitypackage file. Importing Unity Packages To import a package into another project, double click the \u201c.unitypackage\u201d file with a project open and an import window will appear. You can also click Assets > Import Package > Custom Package\u2026 to select the unitypackage file via explorer/finder.

What are the affordances (opportunities for interaction or game mechanics) of the game environment? Are there any properties or affordances that are unusual or that you didn't expect? Body For the actual physical game: What tools or appendages are used to play the actual physical game? What are the properties and affordances of those tools? Are there any properties or affordances that are unusual or unexpected? For your digital game: What tools or appendages does the player use to play your digital game? What are the properties and affordances of those tools? What ways can you think of adapting the physical affordances and properties to the digital? What are some affordances that only the digital game can have? Mind What are the rules of your game? How does play proceed? Consider drawing a flow chart. How is your game scored? Does it have an unusual or idiosyncratic scoring system, like Golf or Tennis? Research the strategy of your game. Are there certain rules of thumb that players follow to succeed in the game? What decisions is a skilled player making on a moment to moment basis, and why? What resources does a skilled player manage during the game? stamina? number of shots left? Final Submission Your final project should have the following elements: Physics Your game must use the Rigidbody component to simulate physics-based motion and collision. Experiment with the mass, drag, and angular drag of the ball to obtain results appropriate for your sport. A bowling ball has very different properties than a ping pong ball! Use Rigidbody.AddForce or Rigidbody.AddForceAtPosition to adjust velocity . Consider when to use the different force modes : Force, Acceleration, Impulse, VelocityChange Use OnCollisionEnter to detect when objects collide , and play appropriate sounds Use OnTriggerEnter to detect when objects enter an area , such as a scoring zone or an out-of-bounds zone. Gameplay Your game should keep track of one or more player's score . Scores should be determined more or less according to the rules of the game you are adapting. Consider how your game mechanics and level design can offer different strategic options and play experiences. For example, you could research how factors like spin or tilt affect the game you are adapting, and consider whether your game should include a way for players to spin the ball or tilt the playing area. -- For instance, this diagram shows how topspin affects the trajectory of the ball in table tennis. The ball would have fallen off the table if it's trajectory had not bent downwards due to spin! You could also explore how different terrains for your playing field can affect the gameplay. See examples of ping pong variations by Laurent Perbos, Gabriel Orozco, and Lee Wen. How would these tables change the experience of playing table tennis? -- Laurent Perbos - Ping Pong Pipe -- Laurent Perbos - Console -- Gabriel Orozco - Ping Pond Table -- Lee Wen - Ping Pong Go Around What other affordances can digital games offer beyond changing the shape of the playing field? Animated obstacles? AIs? Alternative control schemes? Genre mashups? -- Theo Triantafyllidis - Pin Pon . \"Pin Pon is a game about online dating. Using a leap motion controller, players try to bounce stuff off their part of the table and into the opponents.

Players of real-life games like tennis are able to control the velocity and spin of their of the ball with subtle changes to how they strike the ball with the racquet. Traditional game controls, whether it's a gamepad or mouse and keyboard, don't usually offer this level of control! Consider how you allow the player to interact with the ball in 3D space. How would you design an interface for your game that feels expressive and true to the original sport? How do existing games manage this complexity? For instance, there are many different examples of how tennis can be adapted to the screen: Pong presents a top-down view of the court. The ball moves in straight lines, and bounces off the sides of the screen. The player controls one of two paddles, which can only move on the vertical axis. Pong is all about positioning, the ball bounces off the paddle without extra input from the player. Tennis for Two presents a side-on view of the court, which emphasizes the arcing trajectory of the ball over the net. In Tennis for two, players control their horizontal position with a dial, and must press a button to strike the ball. 3D tennis games like Virtua Tennis present a tennis court rendered in 3D, with the camera positioned up high behind one of the two players. Players are able to move their avatar using a 2D directional interface (such as a d-pad or analogue stick), and usually must press a button to strike the ball. Different games will approach aim, spin, and power in a variety of ways. How would you give the player nuanced control of the ball in a game like this? Visual Communication Consider the look and feel of your game, including lighting, materials, and more. If you wish, you may use 2D or 3D assets to compose your scene. Use visual elements to communicate the state of the game to the player. Lines, meters, and arrows, can be useful for indicating aim, force, spin, and more. Particle effects or a trail renderer can help draw attention to a fast moving object. Sound Don't forget that sound can be a powerful communication tool, and can help make a game feel more expressive. Consider increasing the volume and pitch of a sound effect based on how hard the ball collides with another object, or consider giving moving objects a \"whoosh\" sound that changes pitch and volume according to the object's speed.

Classwork focuses on familiarizing students with game engines, computer programming concepts, player experience, and other skills that are foundational to making digital games. Lectures, exercises, and class projects teach skills needed to create digital games including custom rules, interactive physics systems, vectors, generative or randomized levels, save data, custom input systems, score-keeping, and sound. This course is offered in parallel with the concurrent courses, Game Design and Interactive Animation. Course Prerequisites DESMA 24 Motion DESMA 101 Media Arts Introduction / DESMA 104 Design Futures This course will be heavy on C# scripting in Unity scripting API. If you haven't fulfilled the above pre-requisites but have prior experience in either writing code or using the Unity game engine , please let me know. Learning Outcomes By the end of this course, you will be able to create a real-time, interactive software with custom rules, generative or randomized levels, save data, responsive controls, physics, sound, and simple animation. The skills you will learn in this class translate well to immersive media, generative animation, and other modes of human-computer expression. Course Outline Unit 1: Generative Computation Using generative design to create random/unique/dynamic ecosystems, worlds, characters, and events in Unity. Week 0-3 Intro to Unity Game Engine and C# , Vector fundamentals , Prefabs and Instantiation , Arrays and Randomness, UI Project 1: Auto-Generator Unit 2: Playing with Physics Using physics, math, and other game engine tools to design environments and mechanics for interactive gameplay. Week 4-6 Level Design , Input Systems , Physics Simulations , Static Variables and Singletons, Sound Project 2: Ball Game Remix Intermission: Alt-Engines Explore other tiny game engines! Week 7 Micro Game Jam(s) -- Make an entire game in a single class. Unit 3: Save && Scene Using persistent data, effects, and cinematic affordances of the game engine to revise and refine your projects. Week 8-10 Cinemachine, Animation, Coroutines, Persistent Data Project 3: Final Project (TBD) Assignments and Grading See How To Submit on instructions for submitting Unity projects Course Breakdown Project 1: 15% Project 2: 25% Project 3: 25% Reading / Homeplay responses: 15% Participation / Attendance: 20% Evaluation Criteria Projects Considering the likelihood that everyone is coming in with different skillsets and coding experiences, the expectation for this class is that you approach each project with your own level of skill and comfort in mind. Design a project for yourself that pushes your technical skills a little bit , but also allows you to lean into your existing strengths and practices. We will evaluate your projects based on: Timely submission Did you submit your project on time? (see Late Work for more details.) Completion of Project Deliverables Does your project meet the requirements of the assignment? Attention to detail and craft Does the project run? Are there unintended bugs, glitches, etc. Project scope / aesthetic and technical ambition Are you doing the bare minimum, or are you pushing yourself technically and/or aesthetically? Creative risk-taking and resourcefulness Are you pushing the limits of the tools? Hacky solutions are perfectly acceptable and encouraged! Readings / Homeplays You will be assigned occasional readings and games that are related to this course, accompanied by a questionnaire for you to complete and bring to class. These are graded pass/fail -- if you did the work, you will get full credit. Participation / Attendance This is an in-person course , so please come to class on time. We will be covering a lot of content quickly, so it is very important that you are present for each day. If you are more than 15 minutes late, you will be marked as late. Three late marks results in an unexcused absence. Any disputes should be discussed with the TA within two weeks If you anticipate having to miss class, email the TA prior to the class. Absences will not be excused after the fact, except in extreme circumstances. You get one unexcused absence before it starts affecting your grade. Each unexcused absence that follows will result in one full letter grade deduction from your participation score. Your participation grade will also be determined by your level of engagement in class. If you seem disengaged or are disruptive in class, we will reach out and discuss the matter with you. If a pattern of disruption or disengagement continues, we will be taking note and it will be reflected in your grade. Other assignment-related rules Late Work On the day the project is due: Projects should be ready to play prior to the beginning of class. Project files and documentation should be submitted by 11:59PM the same day. After the due date, a full letter grade will be deducted from the project grade for each class day that the assignment is late. If you anticipate that you won\u2019t be able to complete the work by the due date, please contact us before the due date so we can discuss options. Appropriation, Fair Use, and Generated Content You should strive to develop your own assets for your project submissions. The use of existing prompt-based AI generation programs, including but not limited to ChatGPT, DALLE, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney, is not allowed in this class. You may consider this to be one of the limitations of this class -- you are here to learn a specific set of technical skills, and the most advisable way to engage with this course is to not use these programs at all. There are many other reliable solutions and resources available to you, please use this opportunity to explore them. If you're planning to borrow or generate assets from somewhere else, you must consult the instructor beforehand AND be able to justify your decision for doing so. While developing early stage prototypes and testing mechanics, it is acceptable to use placeholder assets. No credit will be awarded for plagiarised work. All submitted projects should be original and developed within the duration of this class. Remember to acknowledge / cite your tools and sources appropriately in your submission. Resources Readings / Games All assigned readings and games will be provided for you -- no need to purchase textbooks for this class. (see Readings & Homeplays for more details.) Required Tools Unity -- Please install Unity Hub and get the latest LTS version of Unity Editor (currently 2022.3.43f1). Other editor versions may differ slightly from each other, but anything 2021 or later should be ok. Visual Studio -- Install Microsoft Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, you should have the option to do this when installing Unity. Recommended Tools 2D and 3D production software of your choice: Krita -- professional free and open source digital paint tool. Blender -- powerful free and open source 3D art and animation tool.

Campus-wide resources and information Land Acknowledgement The University of California, Los Angeles occupies the ancestral, traditional, and contemporary Lands of the Tongva and Chumash peoples. Our ability to gather and learn here is the result of coercion, dispossession, and colonization. We are grateful for the land itself and the people that have stewarded it through generations. While a land acknowledgment is not enough, it is the first step in the work toward supporting decolonial and indigenous movements for sovereignty and self-determination. Read more about what land you\u2019re occupying: https://native-land.ca/ Other resources on land repatriation: UCLA Mapping Indigenous LA -- an online archive of a storymapping research project about indigenous Los Angeles peoples, histories, and geographies from past and present. California History (Winter 2023), Respecting the Ancestors: On Repatriating American Indian Remains -- 2023 essay report on the history of repatriating indigenous peoples remains (mostly a lack thereof), including UC-specific case studies. Decolonization is not a metaphor -- article on what is unsettling about decolonisation as a caution against the loose use of the term in advocacy and scholarship. Commitment to Diversity & Safer Spaces We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use preferred pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however our differences affect our conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students, TA, and instructor is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one another. Alternatively, if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructor or TA. (Statement adopted from voidLab at https://github.com/voidlab/diversity-statement ) COVID-19 It is important that everyone stay safe and avoid coming to class if you have any concerns about your health status. If you find that external struggles and/or COVID related challenges are affecting your ability to attend class, please reach out to us. We want you to be successful in the class, but we care about your well-being more than anything else. Open communication with us is most important in this regard, please let us know if you're sick and/or require additional accommodations.

Let's break this question down. First of all... What is a Game? A game is an experience, and that experience has a certain character. [...] And if we\u2019re discussing an experience, then that implies someone is there to have that experience, someone we refer to as a player. We can\u2019t talk about a game without talking about the experience of the player playing that game, even if the playing experience we\u2019re talking about is often our own. The experience we call a game is created by the interaction between different rules , but the rules themselves aren\u2019t the game, the interaction is! A game can\u2019t exist without a player or players : someone needs to be engaging with the rules for the experience to happen. -- Chapter Three, Rise of the Videogame Zinesters. Anna Anthropy. For example, in a game of tag, what are the rules for... THE SETUP -- how do you decide who's \"it\"? when can they start tagging people? THE LEVEL / PLAYING FIELD -- how far can players go before they're \"out-of-bounds\"? are there safe zones where people can't be tagged? PLAYER BEHAVIOUR -- are players only allowed to travel in a certain manner (e.g. speedwalking, but no running), and how can that be enforced (e.g. speedwalking means both feet cannot be lifted off the ground at the same time at any moment.) If someone gets tagged, what happens to them? Do they freeze in position, become \"it\", or are they out of the game? CONCLUDING THE EXPERIENCE -- how do you know when the game has ended, and who the winner/loser is (if any)? \"Is xxx a game?\" -- is this a game? by sweetfish on itch.io. Technically, this question is irrelevant to this class. Regardless of what you end up making for your assignments, you'll eventually have to make decisions about the parameters and conditions of your project (which you could think of as being \"the rules of your game\") and consider how one's interaction / encounter of these \"rules\" will affect their overall experience of it. In this class, we will focus on how to implement these rules using game engines , so that you can explore its creative affordances for designing particular experiences.

Put them together... GAME ENGINE! Returning to our first question: What is a game engine? -- guess we doin games now by morry kolman (@WTTDOTM) Tools designed specifically for developing games (e.g. Unity, Bitsy , PICO-8 , in-game level builders ) Platforms which primarily serve some other non-game-making function (if any at all), but are nonetheless used for making games. (e.g. Spread sheets , Checkboxes , Post-war junkyards and bombsites ) -- When Play Is Criminalized: Racial Disparities in Childhood . Eisa Nefertari Ulen, TRUTHOUT. If a game is \"an experience that is made from the interaction between different rules\" , then broadly speaking, a game engine could be anything that converts rules and interaction into playable experiences. Unity is a Game Engine We'll spend most of this course working in the Unity game engine. Unity, initially released in 2005, is a closed-source game engine, and Unity Technologies, the developer of the engine, has been a publicly traded company since 2020. The engine gained popularity through being free for small, independent developers, with a relatively easy learning curve. Compared to most other game engines, Unity also tries to avoid being aesthetically identifiable and not be tied to a particular genre of game. Other industries use Unity for things like Architectural and Auto rendering, Film and TV production , AI training and computer vision . Unity also contracts with the US Department of Defense for military training and simulation. Anatomy of the Unity Editor -- Unity Editor window in default workspace layout Read the following articles from the Unity User Manual: Unity's interface GameObjects Transforms Using Components Unity C# Unity uses C#, a type of object-oriented language , as one of its primary scripting languages. We typically write Unity C# scripts to make customised blueprints for accessing, organising, and implementing data inside our game project. This is helpful for: storing information such as variables and functions inside an object or class ; programming interactive / dynamic behaviour in objects; MonoBehaviours Most of the time, we're working with a class called MonoBehaviour which behaves like a component that can be attached to any gameobject in our scene. Whenever we make a new C# script in Unity, we are creating custom classes that inherit from another class called MonoBehaviour by default. This allows us to use the methods and functionality from the MonoBehaviour class. public class NewBehaviour : Monobehaviour{...} Let's create a Unity C# script! When writing any sort of code, here's the general thought process: OUTPUT -- \"I need my script to do THIS ...\" INPUT -- \"... so I need to access THESE VARIABLES ...\" METHOD -- \"... and call THESE FUNCTIONS in order of THIS SEQUENCE .\" It is very common to start by looking for solutions on Unity's Documentation page or other community forums. There is no expectation to memorise every single thing -- the longer you work in Unity, the more familiar you become with its interface and workflow, and you'll eventually find yourself not needing to look things up as often as you used to. Anatomy of a C# Script If you are new to coding in C# , watch this video for a brief introduction to C# Variables and Functions in Unity. Naming your C# Scripts use pascal case , (i.e. first alphabetical letter is capitalised, and every new word is marked with a capitalised case, no spaces.) e.g. MyScript.cs the file name of the script and the name of the MonoBehaviour must be exactly the same (case-sensitive) . e.g. if your C# file name is \"ScoreManager.cs\", then the line declaring your Monobehaviour class in that script file should look like this: public class ScoreManager : MonoBehaviour {...} the name must be unique -- no two MonoBehaviours should have the same name. Namespaces A C# script typically starts with a list of namespaces, which are reference libraries containing all the methods and classes for a specific context. The name of each namespace is typically placed after using . using UnityEngine Variables and Functions Each class has a block of code that defines what its properties (aka variables) and methods (aka functions) are. These properties and methods should be enclosed within the curly braces for that class. public class MyNewScript : MonoBehaviour { public int someProperty; void SomeMethod() { } } Variables Variables are labelled data containers that represent properties for that class. These variables can be assigned values, and whose read/write access can be set by declaring them as public or private. Most properties in a component are likely accessible in some way via scripting (to learn more, Unity scripting reference is your best friend!) When creating variables: declare access permissions in lowercase (default: private ) declare what type of variable it is float - a numerical value that can be in decimals int - a numerical integer (whole numbers only) bool - binary property that can be either assigned 'true' or 'false' string - a sequence of characters other public classes including GameObject and components (e.g. Transform ) name the variable no spaces allowed. use camel case. int numberOfCamels use clear and descriptive nouns, the intent of this variable should be immediately apparent from its name if it is a bool, prefix with a verb (typically phrase as a question.) bool isWalking, hasSpecialAbility; use prefixes with an underscore to differentiate private member variables from public ones. private bool _currentHealth; private static int s_winScore; Functions There are two main types of functions: method functions -- a way to group lines of code under one name; good for if you need to call a specific set of codes multiple times; event functions -- automatically tells Unity what to do at very particular instances in the game. Functions may take in variables as arguments, which can be passed in parentheses () and each separated by a comma. When creating functions: declare access permissions in lowercase (default: private ) what type of value it returns in lowercase (if any) -- void returns no value. name of the function in pascal case, followed by parenthesis containing any argument variables. float MultiplyByTwo(float initialFloat){...} Key principles of Programming in Unity C# Single Responsibility -- Every module of code (class, function, etc.) should have a one and only purpose in the software functionality. This will be very helpful for: debugging scripts making your scripts easily reusable for other projects. Keep everything private unless it absolutely needs to be public. if a variable just needs to be visible in the Inspector but does not need to be publicly accessible, you should keep it private then add [SerializeField] before it. [SerializeField] bool _currentIndex; Anticipate errors, and help your script help you catch them if your script absolutely needs a type of component, precede your Monobehaviour declaration with [RequireComponent(typeof(ComponentName))] use Debug.Log and Debug.LogError to check for incorrect / null references.

Review from last class GameObjects and Components C# Variables and Functions : How to declare and initialise a variable? How to write and call a custom method function? Event functions -- void Start() and void Update() Exercise from last class Can you write a script that forces a GameObject to start at a specific position in the scene? Transforms Read about Transforms in the Unity Manual. Every GameObject has a Transform component, which can be accessed via scripts using gameObject.GetComponent<Transform>() or gameObject.transform . Using the Transform component, you may access the following properties: Position , Rotation , and Scale Parent-Child Hierarchy Global and Local Transforms Vectors Read about Vector3 in the Unity Manual. A vector is a group of numbers -- a 2D vector contains two values (x, y), and a 3D vector contains three values (x, y, z). In Unity, 3D vectors are represented by a data structure called Vector3 , which contains three float values represented by x, y, and z respectively. Vector3(float x, float y, float z) When handling spatial and directional information in three dimensional contexts, we are typically working with Vector3 data structures. Vector3 variables and properties To declare and initialise a Vector3 variable: Vector3 someVector = new Vector3(2,4,5); // \"Vector3\" on the LEFT declares what type of variable \"someVector\" is; // \"new Vector3()\" on the RIGHT acts as a constructor method // that creates and initialises a new Vector3 with xyz-values (2, 4, and 5). Note: Even in 2D projects, transform properties are still stored as Vector3 data. In this context, you could choose to declare Vector3 variables in this way: someVector = new Vector3(2,4); // which is the same as \"new Vector3(2,4,0)\" (ie. z-value is 0) To access x, y, and z components of a Vector3: Debug.Log(someVector.x); Debug.Log(someVector.y); Debug.Log(someVector.z); In Unity, you can also use shorthands for calling specific 3D vectors. Vector3.zero //Vector3(0,0,0) Vector3.one //Vector3(1,1,1) Vector3.forward //Vector3(0,0,1) Vector3.right //Vector3(1,0,0) Vector3.up //Vector3(0,1,0) //etc. Using Vectors in Unity Vectors can represent position , scale , rotation , and direction of an object in space, relative to X, Y, and Z axes. Position Vector3 as spatial coordinates. Origin is at (0,0,0). Scale Vector3 as relative scale. Rotation Vector3 as rotational configuration. In Unity, rotation values are internally processed as Quarternion values, which are more convenient for the computer to work with. In the inspector, we are reading eulerAngle representations of rotation in degrees along the X, Y, and Z axes. Direction Vector3 as relative direction. Vector Math Operations Addition (+) Make an object move at a given velocity position += velocity * Time.deltaTime; Make an object move at an accelerated velocity velocity += acceleration * Time.deltaTime; position += velocity * Time.deltaTime; Make an object (e.g. camera) follow another object at a given offset Usually it's easier to do this by parenting one object to another, but sometimes that configuration just doesn't work for your purposes... In that case, you may consider using vector math! Unity's Roll-a-ball tutorial uses a similar technique for setting up a camera that follows the player object. //LateUpdate is another event function //that is called every frame, but after Update() void LateUpdate() { //follow target position at offset //AFTER target position changes in Update() gameObject.transform.position = target.position + offset; } Spawn objects at regular intervals We'll discuss this next class when we get into arrays and instantiation! Subtraction (-) Determine direction from one point to another fromAToB = B - A; //and if we just need the unit of this direction vector //we can normalize it. unitDirection = fromAToB.normalized; Determine the distance between 2 points fromAToB = B - A; float distanceAB = fromAToB.magnitude; //OR we can use the Vector3 method \"Distance()\" float distanceAB = Vector3.Distance(A,B); Multiplication (*) Scale the size / length of a vector someVector *= multiplier; Flipping a vector's direction someVector *= -1; Normalizing Vectors Normalized vectors always have a magnitude of 1. This is useful for when you're using vectors only for its directional orientation. normalizedVector = someVector.normalized; Dot Product Read about Vector3.Dot in the Unity Manual. Dot product is useful for comparing the directions of two different vectors. float dotProductAB = Vector3.Dot(A,B); if (dotProductAB==0){ //A and B are perpendicular } else if (dotProductAB==1){ //A and B are pointing in exactly the same direction } else if (dotProductAB==-1){ //A and B are pointing in completely opposite directions } Cross Product Read about Vector3.Cross in the Unity Manual.

Prefabs Read about Prefabs in the Unity Manual. Prefabs allow you to store a GameObject and its information (including its components, property values, child objects, etc.) into your Unity project folder as a reusable Asset . This Prefab Asset can be used as a base template from which you can create and modify new Prefab instances in the scene. How to create a Prefab from an existing GameObject in the scene Click and drag the GameObject from the Scene Hierarchy into your project folder panel. The GameObject should now be marked with a blue icon, and have an arrow button to the right of its name that leads you to the Prefab editor. How to Instantiate a GameObject We use the Instantiate() method function to spawn new instances of a GameObject in our scene. Instantiate(someGameObject); You could also pass a GameObject instance into a GameObject variable . This allows you to reference it later in your script. GameObject obj = Instantiate(someGameObject); //let's say we want to change the position of this instance obj.transform.position = someVector; //or set it to a new parent obj.transform.parent = someParentObject; The Instantiate() method can also be called in other ways that allow you to pass multiple parameters at once . The Unity Scripting API lists all the different ways you can declare the Instantiate() function. For example: GameObject obj = Instantiate( spawnThisGameObject, //GameObject atSomePosition, //Vector3 atSomeQuaternionRotation, //Quaternion underSomeParent); //Transform Loops Loop functions allow you to repeat an action multiple times. Watch the Unity Tutorial below to learn about: While loops Do-while Loops For Loops ... and one more video about Foreach Loops . Arrays Read about Arrays in the Unity Manual. Arrays allow you to store multiple objects in a single variable . Each object in an array is attached to an index number, starting from 0 . This index number is used when calling this object from the array. string[] fruits = {\"apples\", \"pears\", \"oranges\"}; // fruits[0] will return \"apples\" // fruits[1] ... \"pears\" // fruits[2] ... \"oranges\" Every array has a Length property, which gives you the number elements in the array. string[] fruits = {\"apples\", \"pears\", \"oranges\"}; Debug.Log(\"Length of fruits array: \"+ fruits.Length); // console will print \"Length of fruits array: 3\".

Review from last class Prefabs and Instantiation Creating a prefab Instantiate() method Arrays How to declare and initialise arrays How to get an element from an array Random.Range() Randomness Sometimes we want to randomize the behaviour of our game, for procedurally generating levels, for adding variation to the behavior of NPCs, and more. Random.Range Read about Random.Range in the Unity Scripting API. There are two versions of Random.Range: one that returns a random float within a minimum inclusive float and maximum inclusive float; Note: you can make any number a float by adding an 'f' at the end. float randomFloat = Random.Range(0.5f, 2.5f); // returns a random float between 0.5 and 2.5, including 0.5 and 2.5 float randomFloat = Random.Range(2f, 4f); // returns a random float between 2 and 4, including 2 and 4. and one that returns a random integer within a minimum inclusive integer and maximum exclusive integer. int randomInteger = Random.Range(0, 3); // returns a random integer between 0 and 3, including 0 but excluding 3, // ie. possible outcomes are 0, 1, and 2. Using Random.Range with Conditional Statements We can use Random.Range and conditional statements to determine what actions happen depending on the random output number, as well as the probability of each outcome. For example, a coin toss can be set up using a random integer ... int coinToss = Random.Range(0,2); // the only possible outcomes are 0 and 1. if (coinToss == 0){ Debug.Log(\"Heads\"); } else { // if coinToss == 1 Debug.Log(\"Tails\"); } ... or a random float . Both are doing the exact same thing, because the probability of either outcome is exactly the same (50% chance). float coinToss = Random.Range(0f,1f); // outcome can be any decimal number between 0 to 1, including 0 and 1. if (coinToss > 0.5f){ // if coinToss is more than 0.5f Debug.Log(\"Heads\"); } else { // if coinToss is less than or equal to 0.5f Debug.Log(\"Tails\"); } You can also set up your outcomes with an uneven probability . float badCoin = Random.Range(0f,1f); if (badCoin > 0.7f){ // if coinToss is more than 0.7f Debug.Log(\"Heads\"); // this has a 30% chance of happening } else { // if coinToss is less than or equal to 0.7f Debug.Log(\"Tails\"); // this has a 70% chance of happening } The above examples use if-else statements to select which actions to run based on what the random number is. You can also use switch statements , which are helpful for working with a longer list of possible outcomes . This is because switch statements evaluate all possible outcomes and proceed immediately to the relevant \"case\" index, instead of evaluating the conditions one by one according to the order listed in an \"if-else\" chain. Switch statements will look at one variable (placed inside the parentheses), and switch across different listed outcomes (each listed as a case index) until it finds one that matches the current value. Each case must end off with a break; statement to exit the loop. int diceRoll = Random.Range(1,7); //possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. switch (diceRoll) { case 1: // if diceRoll == 1 Debug.Log(\"Rolled a 1.\"); break; // exit loop case 2: // if diceRoll == 2 Debug.Log(\"Rolled a 2.\"); break; // exit loop //etc... case 6: // if diceRoll == 6 Debug.Log(\"Rolled a 6.\"); break; // exit loop default: //acts like an \"else\" statement to catch all other outcomes not listed above. Debug.Error(\"Invalid roll number.\"); break; // exit loop } Using Random.Range with Arrays You can use Random.Range (for random integers) to pick elements out of an array at random by using the length of the array as the second argument. string[] names = new string[]{\"alfred\",\"bruno\", \"cynthia\",\"dianne\",\"esther\"}; int pick = Random.Range(0, names.Length); Debug.Log(names[pick]); //prints one of the names in the array at random. Noise We will learn about two kinds of noise: random noise and perlin noise Random Noise In random noise, the values generated are completely random and have no correlation to one another . This creates a very grainy and chaotic texture. -- Noise made with random noise And because the random values are independent of one another, if we were to transfer one area of random noise onto another (with all other parameters kept the same), it blends in seamlessly. -- Random noise feels uninterrupted regardless of the transposition of values. Perlin Noise If you're curious about the mathematical logic behind perlin noise generation, I recommend watching this Youtube video, Perlin Noise Explained (start from 06:45). Sometimes in computer graphics, we want to use seemingly random values that are smoothly interpolated across one another. In these situations, we could get \"smooth\" random values with Perlin Noise . -- Noise made with perlin noise In perlin noise, neighbouring values are related to each other through the smooth interpolation from one area to another. Therefore, if we were to move one area of perlin noise onto another, the smooth interpolation is disrupted, and we can clearly see where one area starts and ends. -- Transposition of values becomes very clear in perlin noise. Mathf.PerlinNoise Read about Mathf.PerlinNoise in the Unity Scripting API. In Unity, we can use Mathf.PerlinNoise to generate Perlin noise across a 2D plane. To use this method, we pass two sample points along the X and Y axes in floats into the function, and it will return a float value between approaximately 0 and 1 which corresponds to the colour of the noise in those exact coordinates (Black is 0; White is 1.) (Note: return value might be slightly below 0.0 or beyond 1.0.) Using Random Seeds in Perlin Noise Because Perlin noise is a pseudo-random pattern of float values (i.e. it's not truly random), the same sample X and Y coordinates will return the same value. You can use Random.Range to randomize the X or Y coordinates to sample random parts of the Perlin noise image. float randomSeed; // Note: // A (random) seed is like a starting sample coordinate // that can be passed into a pseudorandom generator like perlin noise // to create a replicable outcome. void Start() { randomSeedY = Random.Range(0f, 100f); } void Update() { float x = Time.time; float y = randomSeed; float someNoiseValue = Mathf.PerlinNoise(x,y); } Remapping Output Range in Perlin Noise Because the range of values in Perlin noise is limited to 0:1, we typically need to translate this value to a diferent range . For example, you could use a little algebra to remap the noise value range from 0:1 to -1:1: float someNoiseValue = Mathf.PerlinNoise(x,y); float remappedNoise = (someNoiseValue * 2) - 1; You could also use Mathf.Lerp to remap the noise value from 0:1 to a different range of values. This example below remaps noise to -255:255. float noise = Mathf.PerlinNoise(x,y); float remappedNoise = Mathf.Lerp(-255,255, noise); Animating Perlin Noise using Time.time We can pass [Time.time] into our x or y-coordinates to \"march\" across the perlin noise image over time. float x, y, someNoiseValue; void Start(){ y = 0; } void Update(){ x = Time.time; //Time.time is the amount of time that has passed since the start of the application someNoiseValue = Mathf.PerlinNoise(x,y); } This value could be passed into any property in your scene (such as y-position) for procedural animation. -- Perlin noise value is passed into the spheres' y-position; each sphere has their perlin noise sample coordinate offset by an increment of 0.2 in the x-direction. Terrain Generation with Perlin Noise We can pass Perlin noise values into x and y positions to procedurally generate a terrain. -- Terrain generation using cubes and perlin noise. public GameObject prefab; // Start is called before the first frame update void Start() { int seedX = Random.Range(0, 1000); int seedZ = Random.Range(0, 1000); for (float z = 0; z < 100; z++) { for (float x = 0; x < 100; x++) { float y = Mathf.PerlinNoise((x+seedX) * 0.1f, (z+seedZ) * 0.1f) * 2f; if (y > 1) //threshold, only spawn when y is greater than 1 { GameObject instance = Instantiate(prefab); instance.transform.position = new Vector3(x, y*10, z); } } } } Custom Classes for Storing Data Review from our first introduction of C# : We typically write Unity C# scripts to make customised blueprints for accessing, organising, and implementing data inside our game project. This is helpful for: storing information such as variables and functions inside an object or class; programming interactive / dynamic behaviour in objects; Sometimes we need to write custom classes to store data and functions about specific objects. For example, we could have a class that describes specific properties of an object. public class Cat { public string name; public string breed; public float size; public bool hasCollar; public Color furColor; public Color eyeColor; } One way of implementing these custom classes is to use them as small \"helper\" classes inside our scripts. For example, we may want to create a custom class that contains a variety of colour schemes. Because we don't need this information to be attached to a GameObject as a component, we can leave it as a non-MonoBehaviour class. In this case, it's useful to mark this class as \"serializable\", so that the unity editor can see it and edit it. (Note: if your class is already a MonoBehaviour, Unity Editor can already see and edit it, so it does not need to the Serializable attribute.) [System.Serializable] public class ColorScheme { public Color mainColor; public Color accent; } You can include this class in the same script as one of your MonoBehaviour classes , or create a new c# file to contain it. From here, we could store a bunch of possible color schemes in a ColorScheme array, then determine the possible color schemes in the Inspector: public class ColorSchemeRandomizer:MonoBehaviour { public ColorScheme[] colorSchemes; ColorScheme SelectedColorScheme; void Start() { SelectedColorScheme = colorSchemes[Random.Range(0,colorSchemes.Length)]; } } [System.Serializable] public class ColorScheme { public Color mainColor; public Color accent; } Some course reminders Project 1 is due next Tuesday.

Input.GetKey Returns true while the user holds down the key identified. void Update(){ if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.Space)){ Debug.Log(\"Spacebar is held down.\"); //will keep sending console message //for as long as player holds down the spacebar. } } Input.GetKeyDown Returns true during the frame the user starts pressing down the key identified. void Update(){ if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Mouse0)){ Debug.Log(\"Left mouse button pressed.\"); //only sends console message once //even if player continues to hold down the spacebar. } } Input.GetKeyUp Returns true during the frame the user releases the key identified. void Update(){ if (Input.GetKeyUp(KeyCode.Mouse1)){ Debug.Log(\"Right mouse button released.\"); } } These are very simple and straightforward methods for mapping inputs to custom actions, but certainly isn't the only one available! Unity has more organised systems in place for setting up our inputs -- we will discuss those later in the quarter. UI For games it's often useful to add user interface elements like text and images on top of what the camera is seeing. Unity features a UI system, which we can use to add elements to our game like clickable buttons, meters, images, and text. To start with, we'll look at how to add text elements to your project. Create a New TextMeshPro (TMP) UI Object Create a new TMP element by right-clicking in the Scene Hierarchy panel > UI > Text - TextMeshPro . TextMeshPro is an improved version of Unity's legacy text element. I recommend just starting with that whenever you're working with text. The first time you make a TMP element in your project, it will prompt you to import TMP Essential Resources and Examples & Extras. You only need to import Essential Resources to continue using TMP. Read more about Unity's documentation of TextMeshPro here . When you create your first UI element in your scene, Unity automatically adds two other objects -- a Canvas (inside which our TMP element is nested) and an EventSystem . Canvas The Canvas is the container which will hold our UI elements. By default it comes with three components: The Canvas , which determines how and where the UI elements are drawn. The size of the canvas corresponds to the screen. The Canvas Scaler , which controls how individual UI elements scale to fit different screen sizes. I like to change UI Scale Mode from \"Constant Pixel Size\" to \"Scale With Screen size\" , so that UI elements appear the same size no matter what resolution screen the player views your work on. the Graphic Raycaster , which helps with certain interactive UI elements. We can ignore this component for now. Event System The Event System helps make UI elements navigable with both keyboard/mouse, and joystick controls. For now we can ignore this object. If you are not planning to make your UI elements clickable, it is okay to delete this object. UI Element Components All UI elements will have these two components: Rect Transform -- a special kind of transform designed to work with canvases. Canvas Renderer -- a component used to render graphics to the canvas. Using Rect Transforms Read more about Rect Transforms and its properties, including pivots and anchors, in the Unity Manual here . Positioning UI Elements Use the Rect Transform tool (shortcut [T]) to adjust the position and size of UI elements within the canvas. Find it in the tool bar at the upper right of the screen. With the rect tool, you can adjust the anchor position of a UI element by dragging these triangles around the screen. This text element is now anchored to the bottom center of the canvas. You can anchor UI elements to different positions on the screen. For instance, sometimes you might want a health meter to always appear in the lower left corner of the screen, or a dialogue box to always appear in the upper center. Try changing the size of the game view to see how your text elements change position. Anchors can also be stretched across an area so that the UI element resizes relative to the canvas size. You can also edit the anchor point by using this dropdown in the inspector. Hold down SHIFT to set the position and ALT to set the pivot at the same time. Canvas Size & Aspect Ratio By default, your Game preview panel's aspect ratio is set to \"Free Aspect.\" Notice that the canvas changes its size to match the dimensions of the screen! This can cause a lot of confusion when working with UI elements. To fix this problem, Use the dropdown in the Game window to set a fixed aspect ratio or pixel size. I recommend setting it to 1920x1080. You may need to increase the font size of your text, or find the canvas scaler component and change it to \"Scale With Screen Size\" You may also notice that the canvas is way larger than anything else in your scene . That is OK! Controlling UI Elements with Scripts UI elements are components, just like anything else in Unity. You can set their properties when the game is running with code! To work with UI elements , you typically need to include the following statement at the top of your script: using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.UI; //include this line to work with UI elements Once you do, you can work with UI elements like any other component. Scripting for TextMeshPro TextMeshPro is an exceptional case, because its methods and properties are stored in its own namespace called TMPro . For TextMeshPro elements, you will need to add this line at the top of your script, instead of using UnityEngine.UI . using TMPro; To declare TextMeshPro components , you will need to decide which class name to use depending on whether the TextMeshPro component is used as a UI element nested inside a canvas , or a mesh in 3D world space . public TextMeshProUGUI tmpUI; //if tmp is inside the UI canvas. public TextMeshPro tmp; //if tmp is outside the UI canvas. You can also style your text using style tags in arrow brackets <>. I recommend looking at Unity's tutorial on styling TMPro elements to learn more. //Note: the code below does not include other functions //like checking whether to use \"a\" or \"an\" before the color name //nor color randomizer functions for the cube's material. using UnityEngine; using TMPro; public class UpdateText : MonoBehaviour { public TextMeshProUGUI uiTmp; public Color col; public string colorName; //map this function to a button click event. public void SetText(){ string colorHex = ColorUtility.ToHtmlStringRGB(col); // returns color as hexademical string in the format of \"RRGGBB\" uiTmp.text = \"This is a <color=#\" + colorHex + \">\"+colorName+\"</color> cube.\"; } } Custom Font Assets for TextMeshPro You can add custom .ttf and .otf font files into your asset folder, and convert them into a TextMeshPro Font Asset. Go to Window > TextMeshPro > Font Asset Creator . Add your .ttf and .otf font file into Source Font File. Click Generate Font Asset . Unity will tell you if there are any characters missing or excluded from the selected font (this depends on what you put as your Character Set in the Font Asset Creator.) Once you're ready, click Save . You can now use this Font Asset in your TextMeshPro components. Buttons Read about Buttons in the Unity Scripting API. A button element will come with the following things: an Image component, which determines the button's sprite. a Button component, which determines the interactive aspects of the button (including color and transition settings for different button states) a nested Text element in the scene hierarchy, which determines what the button's label reads. -- Button components in Inspector -- Nested TextMeshPro component in Inspector Assigning Functions to OnClick() Event Whenever we click a button, it triggers a UnityEvent called OnClick() . In the inspector, we can tell Unity which method functions should \"listen\" for this event so they can be called once the event is \"invoked\" (ie. when the event happens.) We can add multiple event listeners to the a single UnityEvent, allowing us to simultaneously call as many functions as we want once an event is invoked. To add a method function as an event listener in the Inspector panel: In the On Click () event box, click + to add a new listener to the list. Select the relevant GameObject that contains the component with our desired method function. In the dropdown, look for the method function that we want to run when the event happens. If you want to add a custom function as an event listener through the Inspector panel: The function must be declared public . The function must be nested within a MonoBehaviour class that is attached to a GameObject in your scene as a script component. -- In this example, I'm selecting a Cube object that has a ColorRandomizer script, and adding a SetRandomColor() function as an event listener. Creating a Button to Instantiate New Object and Destroy Previous Object To replace an existing object in the scene with a new instantiation, you will need to use the Destroy() method to remove it from the scene. Destroy() can be used to destroy GameObjects and components. public GameObject[] prefabs; GameObject obj; //this will store the most recently spawned object int previousIndex; //our array index reference of the previously spawned object void Start() { SpawnObj(); // spawn new object at start of scene } // add this as a listener to the button's OnClick() event in the inspector. public void SpawnObj() { //get a random index from prefabs int randomObj = Random.Range(0, prefabs.Length); if (obj != null) //if there is an existing obj in the scene //(i.e. it's not our first time spawning an object) { while (randomObj == previousIndex) // as long as our random index is the same as our previous index { randomObj = Random.Range(0, prefabs.Length); //continue randomising until we get a new index that's different from the previous one. } Destroy(obj); //destroy the old object } previousIndex = randomObj; // update previous index to current index. // spawn the random object and assign it to \"obj\" variable obj = Instantiate(prefabs[randomObj]); } If you don't want to completely destroy that instance of the GameObject or component from your scene , you may consider using SetActive() for GameObjects, and .enabled for components instead. This would just \"switch off\" your objects or components, but keeps them available in the scene so you can switch them back on again. There are also workflows for setting up UnityEvents and Listeners using scripts , but we'll get to that in a later lesson! Lights and Camera Settings Here is a basic overview of some elements you can consider using to easily establish the atmosphere and setting of your project. Light Component Read more about URP's light component in Unity's documentation. Add a Light object to your scene by right-clicking in the Hierarchy panel > Light > choice of Light type (you can change the type in the Light component later on.) -- Light component in the Inspector panel. Some sections you can focus on now are (depending on the type of light you're using): Type : Directional, Point, Spot, Area (baked only) \u2013 see examples of each here Light Appearance / Color : Set color of the light based on color or temperature Intensity : Amount to multiply the light color to control the brightness of the light Indirect Multiplier : Intensity of indirect lighting Shadow Type : None, Soft, Hard Environment Lighting In the Unity Editor, go to Window > Lighting > Environment . Here, you can customize some of the following settings: Skybox Material : The skybox itself is a material that uses a special type of shader to create the impression of an image or color that surrounds the entire scene, which can contribute to the overall color and brightness of a scene. If you are going to use a skybox for your project, I recommend changing the default Unity skybox to a different material. An easy way to do this is to import a custom texture that is compatible for skyboxes (e.g. 360 HDR images or Cubmemaps), and put it in a material asset with a Skybox shader. The Unity Asset store also has plenty of options, many of which are free. Realtime Shadow Colours : Assign an ambient color to your realtime shadows. Environment Lighting Source : You can have your scene be lit with either a skybox material, a gradient, or a solid colour. Fog (nested in \"Other Settings\"): Adds a fog effect for your game, with customizable colour, distribution, and density. Camera Try exploring these settings for your Main Camera object. Projection : You can set your camera to be either Perspective or Orthogonal, and decide how far/close your camera's lens is able to capture ( Field of View for Perspective camera; Size for Orthogonal camera.) -- The same scene shown in perspective mode (left) and orthographic mode (right). Background Type (under Environment section): You can decide between having a Skybox or Solid colour as the background material that your camera renders.

For example all basketball courts have similar shapes, but an outdoor court and an indoor gym offer different experiences, cultures, and moods . Level designers focus on how different game spaces can make players feel and behave . -- The Level Design Book What is level design? There are two ways to understand level design: formal industrial sense of capital-L capital-D \" L evel D esign\" without environment art; broad common sense \"level design\" which includes environment art / anything in a level. For your projects, you will be assessed on level design as a whole (visuals, environment properties, etc.) However, at the prototyping stage when you're developing a level or game mechanic, it's more conventional to take the approach of L evel D esign, which includes building a functional layout with simple maps and grayboxing . Think of this as wireframing a level with placeholder assets. The non-functional \"art\" aspects such as modeling, lighting and texture don't need to happen before you can consider things like navigation, composition, interaction, movement, trajectory, and physical feel of the game. -- Diagram comparing \"Level Design\" vs \"level design\" vs \"environment art\", using process images of Gallente Research Facility from Dust 514. (Source: The Level Design Book ) But before we start thinking about level layout, we need to know... What is your level trying to accomplish? Are you teaching the player a new mechanic? Are you telling a story? Are you making a space for recreational relaxation or competitive battle? Think through what you\u2019re trying to do and jot down what a player should experience over the course of the level, and what should they take away from being or acting in this space? -- An early game description of Atari's Battlezone (1980) -- Atari - Battlezone (1980) In terms of the ball game, think about how the rules of the game are conveyed through visual cues or props on the original playing field's setup and design. (e.g. a line, a point, a bounded area...) For your projects, consider layering your level with your own intentions for: how the level directs a player's experience how objects are revealed to the player what the objects or places can represent how time and space unfolds for the player how you can work with the player's imagination through sensory affect, perception, and cognition / consciousness... or what we call the \"phenomenology\" of the player. Layout After you\u2019ve nailed down what your goals and concepts are for your level. you can begin sketching or laying out ideas. -- Super Mario Bros. (1985) planning sheet (Source: Nintendo ) If you need to communicate your level to others in a team, you\u2019ll need to be more detailed and clear about your level. If it\u2019s just you, then your layout can be a sketch, scribble, or anything that will aid in planning the space. Environmental Expressivity When thinking about a player\u2019s movement through your level, at both micro and macro scales, there are features to consider about the environment that can exist from intrinsic to the concept of the game to helping a player know where to go next . Choice Which are the possible actions? Is there a point of no return? Legibility How does the player understand what they can and can't do in the world. A ladder implies climbing. Red tape implies no crossing.

Unlocking new areas, moving from small tunnels to open fields, different types of rooms (or a series of the same room) How a player experiences a space is strongly influenced by how they arrive in it. Play with dichotomies: cramped -> open ; light -> dark ; mundane -> sacred .

Are we going down into the underworld or climbing towards heaven? How are we getting there and how does that feel? -- Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy (2017) Spatial Memory A place can feel familiar through multiple avenues - via the senses, and via various objects. And, through multiple scales - e.g. going to two Wal-Marts in the USA vs two Costcos in the USA/Japan. The 'components' of a place act together to give you this collection of memories, and if those components are present in high enough density in another part of the world, they can act to dredge up memories - even to the scale of perceiving something to be where it isn't. -- Melos Han-tani - Japanese Costco: A Device For Crossing Spacetime -- KOTAKE CREATE - The Exit 8 -- Aram Bartholl - Dust 1:333 , a sculptural replica of \"one of the most played computer game maps in the world\" from the first person shooter game \"Counter Strike\" Levels of games, virtual environments, can become part of our spatial memories. Some game levels rely on the cues drawn from a collectively shared spatial memory to establish a familiar scape for the players to intuitively navigate. (e.g. those who already know soccer will know what to do with a goal post.) When adapting from an existing game, you may choose to reference, exclude, or modify notable or iconic characteristics of the original environment to guide your player towards different behaviours. ...and perhaps even subvert these expectations! -- Shobon no Action , a.k.a. Cat Mario Mechanical Properties Are there any obstacles, features, or affordances of the game's levels that affect play? Examples might include: different material types of tennis court (clay, grass, etc) animated or dynamic obstacles how the players or game could change the landscape over time. Consider the \"rambunctiousness\" of your levels Game worlds should be substrates, not vessels. Games should suggest the power of nonhuman agency. Game worlds ought to surprise us. Games should entangle us. Games should support a wider range of player-environment interactions. Games should leverage scale. The people who make games should take into account the energy and resource demands of their games. Games should take us outdoors. Graphics shouldn\u2019t be everything.

What are the implications of exercising agency? What about games without agency? -- Molleindustria - MacDonalds Video Game -- Brenda Romero - Train (board game) You may consider what sort of agency is given to your player(s), and what that agency could represent in that context. -- HELO100 - (that really) Boils My Piss Skill VS Chance Aspects of your game that relies on the mastery of one's ability , and others that are left to the unpredictable hands of fate and random probability . -- Jeopardy Another way of viewing chance is in terms of \"risk\" level -- in game design, a standard principle is to balance high risk with high reward , so players are more likely to consider taking riskier actions. Risk assessments can become part of strategic play. Strategy What does the player need to do to win? What decisions does the player make on a moment to moment basis? How do they make those choices meaningfully? Why would they make one choice over another? Thematic Treatment Same mechanics, different theme. -- The first activist game was designed more than 100 years ago by a Quaker woman called Lizzie Magie (it was the first game that obtained a US patent). She believed that the main cause of poverty was land monopoly and the way to solve it was to impose a single uniform tax that would discourage speculation. So she created a game to represent this conflict. Thirty years later a man called Charles Darrow patented a modification of the landlord\u2019s game and turned into a \u201cpro landlord\u201d game.

Using pure vector math to simulate physically \"realistic\" movement would still be possible -- it would just become more complicated! . . . What if I told you Unity has an entire system in place for simulating physics-based motion ? \ud83d\udc40 Physics Engine The two main components you will work with are the Rigidbody and the Collider Rigidbody Read Unity's overview of Rigidbody physics and their documentation on the Rigidbody class in the Unity Manual and Scripting API . Responsible for making an object move with physics Has properties like mass , drag , and angular drag , which affect the way an object responds to collisions and forces Movement and rotation can be constrained along the X, Y, and Z axes Moves independently, regardless of parent-child relationship. Kinematic Rigidbodies When isKinematic is \"true\", the rigidbody will not be affected by physics (i.e. animations have to be done by changing transform position in scripts or animation clips). However, they can affect the motion of other rigidbodies through collisions (if detectCollisions is \"true\") or joints (if connected to a non-kinematic rigidbody with a joint.) Collider A shape that the physics engine uses to detect when objects touch Comes in several shapes like sphere , box , and capsule *. (*Note: There are also mesh colliders that take the shape of any custom mesh of choice -- these offer more accurate details in collider shapes, but have some limitations with their range of use.) Multiple can be combined to make more complex shapes. Optionally can add a Physic Material to change bounciness and friction of an object. In the scene view, colliders are visualized with a green outline, and can have its scale, position, and sometimes orientation transformed using Edit Collider or the Edit Bounding Volume tool. Moving a Rigidbody Using with Forces & Torque Read about Rigidbody.AddForce() and Rigidbody.AddTorque() method functions in Unity's Scripting API. This simple spacecraft is controlled in 2D using force and torque . We can \"push\" rigidbodies by applying force to them, and make them spin by applying torque. This technique makes for more physically realistic motion, but can be difficult to control. Use FixedUpdate() to update physics-based methods like AddForce() and AddTorque() . using UnityEngine; public class Rocketship : MonoBehaviour { Rigidbody rbody; bool rocketBoost = false; float spin = 0f; // Start is called before the first frame update void Start() { rbody = GetComponent<Rigidbody>(); } // Update is called once per frame void Update() { //get input in the update function! rocketBoost = Input.GetKey(KeyCode.Space); spin = Input.GetAxis(\"Horizontal\"); //-1 : 1 } //use fixedupdate to update physics //its more consistent than update! private void FixedUpdate() { if (rocketBoost == true) { //pushes the rigidbody rbody.AddForce(transform.up * 100); //transform.up gives us up relative to this object's oriention } //spins the rigidbody rbody.AddTorque(new Vector3(0, 0, 1) * spin * 30f); } } MovePosition Read about Rigidbody.MovePosition() in Unity's Scripting API. Sometimes, we want an object to be able to move in a more controlled way, while still affecting other rigidbodies. This is where MovePosition comes in. The move position function automatically calculates what forces to apply to a rigidbody to move it to a given position. This offers more control over the object's motion. To make it so an object like this is less affected by other objects and forces, make sure to increase its mass and drag . using UnityEngine; public class MovePositionDemo : MonoBehaviour { Rigidbody rbody; float h; public float speed = 4f; // Start is called before the first frame update void Start() { rbody = GetComponent<Rigidbody>(); } // Update is called once per frame void Update() { h = Input.GetAxis(\"Horizontal\"); } private void FixedUpdate() { Vector3 newPosition = transform.position; newPosition += Vector3.right * h * speed * Time.deltaTime; //move the rigidbody to a given position rbody.MovePosition(newPosition); } } Collision Detection Use the following functions to detect when a collision occurs. public class CollisionDemo:MonoBehaviour { void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision) { //occurs the moment a collision begins Debug.Log(\"collision began with \" + collision.gameObject.name); } void OnCollisionStay(Collision collision) { //occurs continuously while two objects touch Debug.Log(\"touching \" + collision.gameObject.name); } void OnCollisionExit(Collision collision) { //occurs the moment two objects stop touching Debug.Log(\"collision with \" + collision.gameObject.name + \" ended\"); } } Note that these functions only work in a script attached to a game object with a rigidbody and a collider. The variable collision provides information about what was hit. For example, you could get the tag belonging to the collider's GameObject. void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision) { if (collision.gameObject.tag == \"Enemy\"){ Debug.Log(\"Enemy hit!\"); } } Collision Detection Modes Discrete (default mode) is the least computationally demanding mode of collision detection, it's good for detecting slow collisions. If you have fast-moving rigidbody collisions, try setting it to Continuous Speculative . If you notice some missed or inaccurate collisions, try using Continuous for collisions with static objects, or Continuous Dynamic for collisions with other fast-moving objects. Triggers You can also use the physics engine to detect when one collider enters the space of another without creating a collision. A collider configured as a Trigger (using the isTrigger property) does not behave as a solid object and will simply allow other colliders to pass through. This is useful for doors, collectables, and more. When a collider enters its space, a trigger will call the OnTriggerEnter function on the trigger object\u2019s scripts. public class TriggerDemo:MonoBehaviour { void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other) { //occurs the moment an object enters the trigger Debug.Log(other.gameObject.name + \" entered the trigger\"); } void OnTriggerStay(Collider other) { //occurs while an object is in the trigger Debug.Log(other.gameObject.name + \" remains in the trigger\"); } void OnTriggerExit(Collider other) { //occurs the moment an object leaves the trigger Debug.Log(other.gameObject.name + \" left the trigger\"); } } 2D Physics Adapting the above scripts and examples to 2D physics requires switching out certain component and function names to their 2D equivalents... which usually just involves adding \u201c2D\u201d to the end . 3D Physics 2D Physics Components Rigidbody Rigidbody2D Collider Collider2D Collision Collision2D Functions OnCollisionEnter OnCollisionEnter2D OnCollisionExit OnCollisionExit2D OnCollisionStay OnCollisionStay2D OnTriggerEnter OnTriggerEnter2D OnTriggerExit OnTriggerExit2D OnTriggerStay OnTriggerStay2D private void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D other) { Debug.Log(\"2D trigger entered.\"); } Exercise In preparation for Project 2...
