Classwork focuses on familiarizing students with game engines, computer programming concepts, player experience, and other skills that are foundational to making digital games. Lectures, exercises, and class projects teach skills needed to create digital games including custom rules, interactive physics systems, vectors, generative or randomized levels, save data, custom input systems, score-keeping, and sound. This course is offered in parallel with the concurrent courses, Game Design and Interactive Animation. Course Prerequisites DESMA 24 Interactivity We will revisit many of the same concepts covered in Interactivity, but using the C# scripting language and the Unity scripting API. If you haven\u2019t taken DESMA 24, but have prior experience with Unity and C#, please let me know. Learning Outcomes By the end of this course, you will be able to create a real-time, interactive software with custom rules, generative or randomized levels, save data, responsive controls, physics, sound, and simple animation. The skills you will learn in this class translate well to immersive media, generative animation, and other modes of human-computer expression.
