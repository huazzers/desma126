## Homeplays

- Sign up for game(s) to play in groups of 2~3;
- 30 ~ 60 minutes of total game play;
- Take notes, ask questions, consider the prompt;
- Take screenshots / recordings if needed.

PC / HTML games will also be available in the PC work stations next to the 4th floor Undergrad Lounge (Exit the elevator, turn right into the lounge, and the PC work stations will be on your right.)

### Homeplay 1

<div class="duedate">
<p>Due: Week 2 Tuesday, October 8
</br><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HrWVxhsBU-uBiyhZhQHnOK0SR3rnjlIrp7U_yHa5O1g/edit?usp=sharing">Sign Up + Submit Presentations Here</a></p>
</div>

Plan to spend about 30 ~ 60 minutes playing the game(s) with your group members, then **prepare a short 5 ~ 7 minute presentation** in response to the following:

1. Tell us about the project
    - What is being generated?
    - What generation method, properties, and constraints (do you think) are being used?
    - How do you interact with it?
2. Consider the effectiveness of this generator and your experience of it -- what works, what doesn't, and why? 
    - Do the generated results feel meaningful, memorable, merely distinguishable, or pretty much the same?
    - Was there something else about the project that was notable in your experience of it -- the camera, gameplay, interface, etc. ?

<br>

**Please share a link to any presentation materials** in the sign up sheet next to your group names. You will share your responses with the rest of the class during lesson time on the due date.
