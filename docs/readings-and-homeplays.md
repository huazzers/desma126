-->

## Homeplays

<!--
Brief descriptions of what homeplays are.

Groups of 3
Minimum time (per game) 30 minutes
Maximum time (per game) 1 hour
Take notes, ask questions, consider the prompt
Take screenshots / recordings if needed-->

### Homeplay 1

<!--
brief on what homeplay 1 is about, 2~3 question prompts, 3~5 minute presentation on (1) what the game is (ideally with screenshots/recordings of the game) (2) answer question prompts

possible inspirations for project 1:

RANDOM CHARACTER GENERATOR
* https://rowanqueue.itch.io/who-you-are -- random animation, character motion, pixel character generation
* http://thecreativeperiod.com/tinysaurServerInstructions/index.html -- random dinosaur generator
* https://jamschutz.itch.io/quick-character-creator -- random question dialogue tree for character creation, object instantiation

    Tell us about the generator - What is being generated, what are the modular pieces that make up the generated result
    Go through about 5~15 results of the generator and consider its method and effectiveness - what properties / constraints does the generator use? Assess / Estimate the possibility space of this generator -- are you able to go through all the variations, or do certain ones feel overused / indistinguishable? In your own opinion, what worked and what didn't, and why?

SAND BOX TERRAINS
* https://sokpop.itch.io/heliopedia -- sandbox game with forward / feedback loop
* https://titouanmillet.itch.io/mu-cartographer -- puzzle game using procedural terrain generation methods, e.g. perlin noise height maps, color lerps, parametric controllers
* https://ncase.me/sim/ -- cellular automata sandbox, with sample simulations modelled off of real-life phenomena (eg. forest fires, epidemics, game of life)


maybe examples on how generation can be applied for worldbuilding
* Wiley's grotto / mudroom game?
* Drawf fortress.

GENETIC ALGORITHMS (maybe join with character generator?)
* Kate compton's plant generator

AI BEHAVIOUR 
* https://boids.cubedhuang.com/ -- boids simulator, with parameter sliders
