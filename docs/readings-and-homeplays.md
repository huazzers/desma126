## Homeplays

- Sign up for game(s) to play in groups of 2-3;
- 30 ~ 60 minutes of game play;
- Take notes, ask questions, consider the prompt;
- Take screenshots / recordings if needed.

### Homeplay 1

<div class="duedate">
<p>Due: Week 2 Tuesday, October 8
</br><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HrWVxhsBU-uBiyhZhQHnOK0SR3rnjlIrp7U_yHa5O1g/edit?usp=sharing">Sign Up Here</a></p>
</div>

Plan to spend about 30 ~ 60 minutes playing the game(s) with your group members.

Then, prepare a short 3 ~ 5 minute presentation in response to the following:

- Tell us about the project -- what is being generated, what generation method, properties, and constraints (do you think) are being used, and how do you interact with it?
- Consider the effectiveness of this generator and your experience of it -- what works, what doesn't, and why? 
    - Do the generated results feel meaningful, memorable, merely distinguishable, or pretty much the same?
    - Was there something else about the project that was notable in your experience of it -- the camera, interaction rules, interface, etc. ?

If you choose to use presentation slides, please share a link to it in the sign up sheet next to your group names.
