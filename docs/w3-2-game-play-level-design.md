Verbs tell us **what the player(s) can do** in the game. 

When pitching or scoping a game project, it's helpful to describe your idea in **a few sentences**, including verbs that introduce the main mechanic(s) of the game.

<br>

For example, when describing a premise: 
<blockquote><p>e.g. A (noun) that (verbs) a (noun) and (verbs) (nouns). </p></blockquote>

And when describing a conditional event or state change: 
<blockquote><p>e.g. If / when (noun) (verbs) a (noun), a (noun) (verbs).</p></blockquote>

<br>

What are the verbs in your game (meaning: what can the player do on a moment to moment basis in your game)?

When considering your own variations, try out different sentences that might be interesting. Remember to **keep your sentences short and simple.** 

As your game grows in depth and complexity, you may find yourself with a rich collection of sentences in your game plan.

## Level

Once you have a list of actions and events, you’ll need **a place** for them to occur. 

<br>

<figure>
<blockquote>
<p>A <b>level</b> is a space where a game happens. [...] All these game spaces set <b>boundaries</b> for players to move and interact.
<br><br>
Different levels offer <b>variation</b>. For example all basketball courts have similar shapes, but an outdoor court and an indoor gym offer different <b>experiences, cultures, and moods</b>.
<br><br>
Level designers focus on how different game spaces can make players <b>feel</b> and <b>behave</b>.</p>
</blockquote>
<figcaption>-- <a href="https://book.leveldesignbook.com/introduction">The Level Design Book</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<br>

### What is level design?

There are two ways to understand level design:

- formal industrial sense of capital-L capital-D "**L**evel **D**esign" *without* environment art;
- broad common sense "level design" which *includes* environment art / anything in a level.

For your projects, you will be assessed on level design as a whole (visuals, environment properties, etc.) 

However, at the prototyping stage when you're developing a level or game mechanic, it's more conventional to take the approach of **L**evel **D**esign, which includes building a *functional* layout with **simple maps** and **grayboxing**.

Think of this as wireframing a level with placeholder assets. The non-functional "art" aspects such as modeling, lighting and texture don't need to happen before you can consider things like navigation, composition, interaction, movement, trajectory, and physical feel of the game. 

<figure>
<img src="../img/leveldesign-vs-environmentart.avif">
<figcaption>-- Diagram comparing "Level Design" vs "level design" vs "environment art", using process images of Gallente Research Facility from Dust 514. (Source: <a href="https://book.leveldesignbook.com/introduction">The Level Design Book</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<br>

But before we start thinking about level layout, we need to know...

### What is your level trying to accomplish?

- Are you teaching the player a new mechanic?
- Are you telling a story?
- Are you making a space for recreational relaxation or competitive battle?

Think through what you’re trying to do and jot down what a player should **experience** over the course of the level, and what should they take away from **being** or **acting** in this space?

<br>

<div class="div-container">
    <div style="width: 47.5%">
        <figure>
        <img src="../img/battlezone game description.png">
        <figcaption>-- An early game description of Atari's Battlezone (1980)</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
    <div style="width: 47.5%">
        <figure>
        <img src="../img/battlezone.png">
        <figcaption>-- Atari - Battlezone (1980)</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
</div>

<br>

In terms of the ball game, think about how the rules of the game are conveyed through **visual cues or props** on the original playing field's setup and design. (e.g. a line, a point, a bounded area...)

![](./img/soccer-field.jpg)

<br>

For your projects, consider layering your level with your own intentions for:

- how the level directs a player's experience
- how objects are revealed to the player
- what the objects or places can represent
- how time and space unfolds for the player
- how you can work *with* the player's imagination through sensual affect, perception, and cognition / consciousness... or what we call the "phenomenology" of the player.

<br>

### Layout

After you’ve nailed down what your goals and concepts are for your level. you can begin sketching or laying out ideas.

<br>

<figure>
        <img src="../img/supermariobros-plan.png">
        <figcaption>-- Super Mario Bros. (1985) planning sheet (Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLoRd6_a1CI">Nintendo</a>)</figcaption>
        </figure>

If you need to communicate your level to others in a team, you’ll need to be more detailed and clear about your level. If it’s just you, then your layout can be a sketch, scribble, or anything that will aid in planning the space.

<br>

### Environmental Expressivity

When thinking about a player’s movement through your level, at both micro and macro scales, there are features to consider about the environment that can exist from **intrinsic** to **the concept of the game** to **helping a player know where to go next**.

<br>

#### Choice

Which are the possible actions? Is there a point of no return? 

![](./img/pointofnoreturn.png)

<br>

#### Legibility

How does the player understand what they can and can't do in the world. A ladder implies climbing. Red tape implies no crossing. 

<br>

#### Signposting

<div class="div-container">
    <div style="width: 47.5%">
        <figure>
        <img src="../img/seasons.jpg">
        <figcaption>-- Scavengers Studio - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/695330/SEASON_A_letter_to_the_future/">SEASON: A letter to the future</a></figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
    <div style="width: 47.5%">
        <figure>
        <img src="../img/bigthundermountainrailroad.png">

</div>

Showing where to go with a big landmark (see [weenies](https://theoryofthemeparks.blogspot.com/2015/08/wayfinding-in-themed-design-weenie.html) in theme park design) - another method can be leading using lighting (tendency to avoid darkness, trying to find a light)

<br>

#### Progression of different spaces

<figure>
<img src="../img/one button nipple golf.png">
<figcaption>-- MICKIE (@jrap) - <a href="https://jrap.itch.io/obng">One button Nipple Golf</a>; The concept/level reveals itself by zooming further back with each level.</figcaption>
</figure>

<br>

Unlocking new areas, moving from small tunnels to open fields, different types of rooms (or a series of the same room)

![](./img/space-progression.jpg)

<br>

How a player experiences a space is strongly influenced by how they arrive in it. Play with dichotomies: 

- **cramped** -> **open**;
- **light** -> **dark**;
- **mundane** -> **sacred**.

<br>

#### Denial and Reward

Add weight to a reveal, induce momentary “lostness”

![](./img/momentarylostness.png)

<br>

#### Easter eggs

Hidden objects, images, and notes elicit close focus on the environment.

<figure>
    <img src="../img/hiddenfolks.png">
    <figcaption>-- <a href="https://hiddenfolks.com/">Hidden Folks</a>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<br>

#### Confusion / Surprise

Did I break the game? Am I supposed to be in this place? Jank can be a form of storytelling.

<div class="div-container">
    <div style="width: 47.5%">
        <figure>

#### Spatial Sound

A call from afar, music in the distance.

    <figcaption>-- Will Herring - <a href="https://grey2scale.itch.io/pet-the-pup">Pet the Pup at the Party</a></figcaption>
</figure>

#### External Forces

Climbing, falling, descending, flying...

Where are you taking us?

Are we going down into the underworld or climbing towards heaven?

How are we getting there and how does that feel?

<figure>
<img src="../img/getoverit.png">
<figcaption>-- <a href="https://youtu.be/DYjbCJXxWLg">Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy</a> (2017)
</figcaption>

#### Spatial Memory

<figure>
<blockquote><p>A place can feel familiar through multiple avenues - via the senses, and via various objects. And, through multiple scales - e.g. going to two Wal-Marts in the USA vs two Costcos in the USA/Japan. The 'components' of a place act together to give you this collection of memories, and if those components are present in high enough density in another part of the world, they can act to dredge up memories - even to the scale of perceiving something to be where it isn't.</p>

</figure>

<br>

Levels of games, virtual environments, can become part of our spatial memories.

Some game levels rely on the cues drawn from a collectively shared spatial memory to establish a familiar scape for the players to intuitively navigate. (e.g. those who already know soccer will know what to do with a goal post.)

When adapting from an existing game, you may choose to reference, exclude, or modify notable or iconic characteristics of the original environment to guide your player towards different behaviours. 

...and perhaps even subvert these expectations!

</figure>

<br>

### Ideas and Inspiration

- [No Clip Website](https://noclip.website/) - online library of digital maps from various notable video games.
- Try and re-imagine a familiar space, but distort the proportions and distances to represent other tangible/intangible aspects (sense of time, feeling, temp, safety.)
- Adapt another piece of media into a level. A chapter of a book. A song.
- Draw a map from memory of something you do every day on the computer / phone / internet … how could you represent a non-spatial thing as a place to be navigated through?

## Play

Here are some elements you may consider as you figure out how you'd like players to interact with the game environment / other players:

### Agency

<figure>
<blockquote><p>The satisfying power to take <b>meaningful action</b> and see the <b>results</b> of our decisions and choices.</p></blockquote>
<figcaption>-- Janet Murray - Hamlet on the Holodeck(1997)</figcaption>
</figure>

*Player agency* is often seen as a central element of what makes games enjoyable as an interactive media, but this is definitely worth weighing against other implications of play.

What are the implications of *exercising* agency? 
What about games *without* agency? 

<figure>
<img src="../img/macdonalds.jpg">
<figcaption>-- Molleindustria - <a href="https://molleindustria.org/mcdonalds/">MacDonalds Video Game</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="../img/train.png">
<figcaption>-- Brenda Romero - <a href="https://brenda.games/train">Train (board game)</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<br>

You may consider what sort of agency is given to your player(s), and what that agency could represent in that context.

<figure>
<img src="../img/boilsmypiss.png">
<figcaption>-- HELO100 - <a href="https://brenda.games/train">(that really) Boils My Piss</a></figcaption>
</figure>


### Skill VS Chance

Aspects of your game that relies on the mastery of one's **ability**, and others that are left to the unpredictable hands of **fate** and **random probability**.

<figure>
<img src="../img/jeopardy.jpg">
<figcaption>-- Jeopardy</figcaption>
</figure>

Another way of viewing chance is in terms of "risk" level -- in game design, a standard principle is to balance **high risk** with **high reward**, so players are more likely to consider taking riskier actions. 

Risk assessments can become part of strategic play.


### Thematic Treatment

Same mechanics, different theme.

<figure>
<img src="../img/landlord-to-monopoly.jpg">
<figcaption>-- The first activist game was designed more than 100 years ago by a Quaker woman called Lizzie Magie (it was the first game that obtained a US patent). <br>
She believed that the main cause of poverty was land monopoly and the way to solve it was to impose a single uniform tax that would discourage speculation. So she created a game to represent this conflict. Thirty years later a man called Charles Darrow patented a modification of the landlord’s game and turned into a “pro landlord” game. It would later become Monopoly.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Learning Curve / Level Difficulty / Flow / Complexity

The difference between learning an ability, and mastering it. 

<figure>
<img src="../img/clop thumbnail.jpg">
<figcaption>-- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-aQrhGtPQ">CLOP 100% complete speedrun, with triple somersault and ending</a> (Youtube video)
</figcaption>
</figure>

> I wasn't kidding when I said I'd beat this game. It's done. Normal life can resume. Got a bit stuck a few times so speed isn't great, but my goodness what a finish. No "lame horse mode" here, this is done properly. 

<br>

Scaling the difficulty of your level in incremental levels can reward players at different stages of mastery. 

And at a particular equilibrium of challenge and skill, you may reach the *flow channel*.

<br>
<figure>
<img src="../img/flow.png">
<figcaption>-- the Flow channel</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>
<figure>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tTVDSOnPLns?si=TCjhlVDXQtRDZdu4&amp;controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<figcaption>-- Thatgamecompany - fl0w Trailer; their co-founder Jenova Chen also wrote <a href="https://www.jenovachen.com/flowingames/thesis.htm">a thesis on flow in game design</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<br>

But if you are considering a more polemical approach that requries moments of critical reflection, you may consider going [against flow](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262045506/against-flow/).

<br>

When adjusting the difficulty of your ball game adaptation, consider the components that offer challenges to (and thus demand mastery skill) from your player. 

How can you complicate these components? Does changing/removing/amplifying/negating any of these make for something more interesting?

Maybe the result isn’t a “good” game, but it becomes interesting, unexpected, outrageous…

### Game Juice / Game Feel

(You'll learn this once you complete [reading response 2](./readings-and-homeplays.md/#reading-response-2)!)

and if you're doing a **multiplayer** game...

### Perfect information / imperfect information

<div class="div-container">
    <div style="width:47.5%">
        <img src="../img/checkers.png">
    </div>
    <div style="width:47.5%">
        <p style="margin-top:0 !important;">A game possesses <i>perfect</i> information if each player, when making any decision, is perfectly informed of all the events that have previously occurred.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="div-container">
    <div style="width:47.5%">
        <img src="../img/amongus.png">   
    </div>
    <div style="width:47.5%;">
        <p style="margin-top:0 !important;"><i>Imperfect</i> information introduces uncertainty but it’s not the same as chance. Some games can have randomness with perfect information and others can have imperfect information without chance.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<br>

### Competition / Cooperation

Direct targeting, such as player elimination;

Cooperating towards a common goal.

Or a little bit of both!

### Symmetry / Asymmetry

Do all players play the game with similar power dynamics, or are their abilities and goals completely different according to what roles they take on?

<br>

### Synchronous / asynchronous

Does play happen at the same time, or are different players acting at different times?
