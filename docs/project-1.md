# Project 1: Auto-Generator

Final Submission Due: Week 3 Tuesday, October 15
---

### Prompt

Create a generator in Unity that either runs automatically, or only requires 1 ~ 2 button controls to run.

</br>
**Consider the following options:**

* a landscape / level / terrain generator;
* a random character generator, eg. exquisite corpse;
* an evolution simulator, e.g. cellular automaton;
* an incremental / clicker game that generates... something!

</br>
**Possible techniques:**

* modular architecture using prefabs, arrays/lists, instantiate/destroy functions, empty transforms as connection points;
* procedural / algorithmic generation using random functions, perlin noise, custom parameters, L-systems, cellular automata, etc.
* feedback / forward loop functions;

</br>
**Tips:**

* Consider what constraints or rules you can impose to create unique forms and color palettes.
* You may work in 2D or 3D. Lean into your strengths as a visual designer / artist as much as possible with this project! (And also remember you don't have much time!)
* Although player interaction is not required, consider how a viewer will see / experience your generative designs. Can they orbit the camera around? Can they press a button to generate new objects?

### Requirements

Project 1 contains TWO COMPONENTS: 
> - **PART 1 (2.5%): SKETCH OF PROJECT PROPOSAL** </br>*Due: Week 2 Tuesday, October 8* </br>A sketch and/or in-progress prototype of your project. Bring this to class for discussion! </br><ul><li>*What are you generating? How are you generating it?*</li></ul>
> - **PART 2 (12.5%): FINAL PROJECT BUILD WITH DOCUMENTATION** </br>*Due: Week 3 Tuesday, October 15* </br>Refer to [submission guidelines](./how-to-submit.md), and submit your final project here (link TBD.) 
> 
> **Total contribution to final course grade: 15%**

</br>
**Your final project is not required to:** 

- be a traditional video game;
- use player input / be an interactive project;
- have sound / audio.

### Evaluation

Your final project will be evaluated according to the guidelines listed in the [course syllabus](./syllabus.md/#evaluation-criteria).
